	abstract = {Because of the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

@article{He2016,
	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

@article{Haber2018,
	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

@article{Rosenblatt1962,
	abstract = {Part I attempts to review the background, basic sources of data, concepts, and methodology to be employed in the study of perceptrons. In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

The relation between the training error and the generalization error is studied in terms of the number of the training examples and the complexity of a network which reduces to the number of parameters in the ordinary statistical theory of AIC. This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set.},

	abstract = {Equivalent staggered grid scheme (ESG) is a new family of schemes based on the finite-difference method (FDM). The method is applied to acoustic wave propagation in variable density media and the results are compared with those from some classic FDM approaches. The main feature of this new family is that it is designed to generate results numerically equivalent to those using the standard staggered grid formulations (SSG), but with the same memory requirements of simple grid schemes. Hence, it results in a reduction of memory usage by 33{\%} in 2D and 50{\%} in 3D problems, compared to the memory usage of SSG. The first-order system of equations in terms of pressure and velocity is not used here. Instead, the formulation is based on applying new central difference operators to the second-order acoustic wave equation in terms of pressure, obtaining the same level of accuracy and stability as the SSG schemes. The equivalence between the ESG and SSG is mathematically demonstrated and issues concerning the application of seismic sources and the boundary conditions are addressed.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

	abstract = {Delineation of bed boundaries is one of the important aspects of petrophysical interpretation. Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90{\%} accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.},

Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural systems have been used in a variety of problems in the fields of science and engineering. Here we describe a study of the applicability of neural networks to solving some geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we study the problem of obtaining formation resistivities and layer thicknesses from vertical electrical sounding (VES) data and that of obtaining 1D velocity models from seismic waveform data. We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as approximately 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404+/-8 Myr--about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O values from 7.4 to 5.0{\%}), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high delta18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a delta18O value from 8.5 to 9.5{\%}. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As geophysicists, we are trained to conceptualize geophysical problems in detail. However, machine learning algorithms are more difficult to understand and are often thought of as simply “black boxes.” A numerical example is used here to illustrate the difference between geophysical inversion and inversion by machine learning. In doing so, an attempt is made to demystify machine learning algorithms and show that, like inverse problems, they have a definite mathematical structure that can be written down and understood. The example used is the extraction of the underlying reflection coefficients from a synthetic seismic response that was created by convolving a reflection coefficient dipole with a symmetric wavelet. Because the dipole is below the seismic tuning frequency, the overlapping wavelets create both an amplitude increase and extra nonphysical reflection coefficients in the synthetic seismic data. This is a common problem in real seismic data. In discussing the solution to this problem, the topics of deconvolution, recursive inversion, linear regression, and nonlinear regression using a feedforward neural network are covered. It is shown that if the inputs to the deconvolution problem are fully understood, this is the optimal way to extract the true reflection coefficients. However, if the geophysics is not fully understood and large amounts of data are available, machine learning can provide a viable alternative to geophysical inversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The main problems arising in the process of the factor space division into the test, validation and training sets were formulated. An approach based on the use of clustering that allowed to increase the entropy of the training set was put forward. Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) were examined as an effective clustering procedure. Based on such maps, the clustering of factor spaces of different dimensions was carried out, and a representative sample was formed. To verify our approach we synthesized the MLP neural network and trained it. The training technique was performed with the sets formed both with and without clustering. The approach under consideration was concluded to have an influence on the increase in the entropy of the training set and (as a result) to lead to the quality improvement of MLP training with the small dimension of the factor space.},

abstract = {Understanding the behavior of Earth through the diverse fields of the solid Earth geosciences is an increasingly important task. It is made challenging by the complex, interacting, and multiscale processes needed to understand Earth's behavior and by the inaccessibility of nearly all of Earth's subsurface to direct observation. Substantial increases in data availability and in the increasingly realistic character of computer simulations hold promise for accelerating progress, but developing a deeper understanding based on these capabilities is itself challenging. Machine learning will play a key role in this effort. We review the state of the field and make recommendations for how progress might be broadened and accelerated.},

abstract = {Field characterization in oil industry is a challenging task which aims to determine or estimate some of the petrophysical properties of a reservoir. These properties are expected to be later used in a non-deterministic workflow (which might depend on subjective interpretations carried out by each petrophysicist) whose aim is to answer questions such as whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. Three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. Obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. Hence, it is common to use other tools (such as wirelogging tools or borehole imagers) to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at which no core sample could be extracted. In this context, estimating lithofacies helps petrophysicists to automatize the process of identifying the lithology of the reservoir. Previous work (Basu et al., 2002; Chai et al., 2009; Linek et al., 2007; Newberry et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1996) used a considerable amount of wirelog data and borehole image logs to induce the lithology of the reservoir. In the work presented in this paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatic reservoir lithofacies identification. Our model relies only on ultrasonic and microresistivity borehole image logs as inputs, which are characterized by a deep residual convolutional network which then infers the probability of each sample to be classified as each type of previously defined lithofacies classes. The method presented in this work was tested on a carbonate well from the Brazilian pre-salt oilfields, and it allowed us to obtain an average classification accuracy of 81.45{\%} and an average area under the ROC curve of 92.70{\%} for all classes, for the blind test sample.},

abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Effective characterization of lithology is vital for the conceptualization of complex aquifer systems, which is a prerequisite for the development of reliable groundwater-flow and contaminant-transport models. However, such information is often limited for most groundwater basins. This study explores the usefulness and potential of a hybrid soft-computing framework; a traditional artificial neural network with gradient descent-momentum training (ANN-GDM) and a traditional genetic algorithm (GA) based ANN (ANN-GA) approach were developed and compared with a novel hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) based ANN (SOM-ANN-GA) method for the prediction of lithology at a basin scale. This framework is demonstrated through a case study involving a complex multi-layered aquifer system in India, where well-log sites were clustered on the basis of sand-layer frequencies; within each cluster, subsurface layers were reclassified into four depth classes based on the maximum drilling depth. ANN models for each depth class were developed using each of the three approaches. Of the three, the hybrid SOM-ANN-GA models were able to recognize incomplete geologic pattern more reasonably, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-GDM models. It is concluded that the hybrid soft-computing framework can serve as a promising tool for characterizing lithology in groundwater basins with missing lithologic patterns.},

Magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data were used to extract geophysical signatures related to the spatial distribution of rock types and to produce a geologic map over the prospective Anapu-Tuer{\^{e}} region. Particular emphasis was given to discriminating and identifying rock types, and the processes related to gold mineralization, which are known to occur in the Anapu-Tuer{\^{e}} region. SOM was able to identify and map distinctive geophysical signatures related to the various geologic units identified on the published geologic map. Furthermore, SOM was able to identify and enhance very subtle signatures derived jointly from the magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data that could be related to geologic processes present in the area.

	abstract = {Convinced by the predictive quality of artificial neural network (ANN) models in ecology, we have turned our interests to their explanatory capacities. Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Northern Amazon Province there is a succession of IS- or IF/IS-type sedimentary basins along the Solim{\~{o}}es/Amazonas river. The westernmost IS-type Acre Basin is interpreted as a retro arc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis (Jordan, 1995). Continental sediments filled a syneclisis from the Carboniferous until the Jurassic, with rocks of marine to continental environment followed by a flexure in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. East of this basin and separated from it by the Iquitos Arch, the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is internally divided in two by the Carauari Arch. It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. This IF-type basin is an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border between Brazil and Guyana, covering some 4,500 km2 of the Brazilian territory. Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. IS-type Cenozoic fluvial and lacustrine clastics of the Solim{\~{o}}es and Boa Vista basins were unconformably deposited above these basins.

	abstract = {Accurate interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data in the presence of static shift arising from near-surface inhomogeneities is an unresolved problem in three-dimensional (3-D) inversion. While it is well known in 1-D and 2-D studies that static shift can lead to erroneous interpretation, how static shift can influence the result of 3-D inversion is not fully understood and is relevant to improved subsurface analysis. Using the synthetic data generated from 3-D models with randomly distributed heterogeneous overburden and elongate homogeneous overburden that are consistent with geological observations, this paper examines the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity on the accuracy of 3-D inversion models. It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

	abstract = {Although large sedimentary provinces, the South Amer- ican intracratonic basins have not been characterized yet as repositories of significant mineral and energy wealths, compared to their counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, heart of industrialized Brazil, hydroelectric power derived from waterfalls developed on the Cretaceous basaltic cover, gemstones and rich soils both derived again from the basalts, and ground- water from Jurassic eolian sandstones are the main resources. Bituminous shales, and more recently, gas discoveries constitute secondary resources; gas seems to characterize the Argentinian Chaco-Paran{\'{a}} Basin. In the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin, the development of significant reserves of gas, and less noticeably of oil, is hampered by the remoteness of the area and lack of a nearby mar- ket. For the same reasons, in the Amazonas Basin large reserves of evaporites lie untouched in the subsurface; recent gas discoveries made near the capital jungle of Manaus point to a brighter future for their exploitation. In the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin, situated in a remote semi-arid region of Brazil, groundwater is the main exploited min- eral resource. Considering their geological characteristics, the small amount of exploration performed in these basins is in sharp contrast with their petroleum potential. Some of their deposits have barely been scratched, suggesting that these areas may be profitable for bold investors},

	Permocarboniferous glacial pavements has already been found in several places in southern Brazil. In the southeast of Parana State there are many occurrences, as the well-known striated surface produced over Devonian basement rocks in the locality of Witmarsun. However, most of the pavements are in fact soft-sediment striated surfaces preserved in the lower part of the glacial Itarare Group itself. At the base of a deglacial sequence exposed in the valley of the Salto River near the Palmeira town, several soft-sand striated surfaces are distributed in four different stratigraphic levels inside cross-stratified sandstones interpreted as deposits of subaqueous outwash fans. Scour marks indicate paleoglacial movement towards the azimuth 341{\textordmasculine}, coherent with the advance of glaciers postulated in regional paleogeographic reconstructions for Permocarboniferous of south Brazil. The surfaces are discontinuous, sometimes slightly concave and associated with linear grooves, and the preservation was favored by thin laminae of fines. These characteristics and the fact that they are not covered by coarse facies like diamictites, allow us to interpret them as soft-sand striated surfaces produced by floating ice. The highly consistent orientation of striations and grooves suggests that they were formed near the grounding zone of an ice shelf in a marine environment, but the surfaces could be ice keel scour marks produced by free-floating ice masses.},

	abstract = {A numerical experiment was applied to explore the potentialities and limitations of joint inversion of IP-affected transients measured with different loop configurations above a uniform half-space with a Cole-Cole complex conductivity. One of us calculated 200 m ?? 50 m and 50 m ?? 50 m loop responses of a uniform polarizable conductor with varied Cole-Cole parameters and imposed synthetic Gaussian noise that simulated measurement errors. Then the generated pseudo-experimental data passed to the other co-author who performed single and joint 1D inversion twice: first being unaware of the "true" underlying models and then after being told that they all were represented by a uniform polarizable earth. More than a half of the fitted models provided a good idea of the true models though misfit was quite large in some cases. The fit was better in single inversion with a priori information available, and improved further through joint inversion of central-loop and coincident-loop responses. Joint inversion with a priori information known was of good quality even at a chargeability as low as 0.02. The standard error in joint inversion was times the measurement error and depended mainly on fitting errors for smaller-loop data. The reason is that the smaller-loop transients included a non-monotonous interval where the signal changed rapidly under the effect of fast-decaying induced polarization. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Breakup of the North Atlantic during the early tertiary was accompanied by widespread and massive magmatism, resulting in the coverage of large areas of the North Atlantic with flood basalts. These flood basalts hamper seismic investigations of underlying sequences and thus the understanding of the rifting, subsidence and evolution of the margin which, in turn, increases the risk for hydrocarbon exploration. In this paper we present a methodology for the simultaneous joint inversion of diverse geophysical datasets, i.e. free air gravity and magnetotelluric soundings (MT) using seismic a priori constraints. The attraction of the joint inversion approach is that different geophysical measurements are sensitive to different properties of the sub-surface, so through joint inversion we significantly reduce the null space and produce a single model that fits all datasets within a predefined tolerance. Using sensitivity analysis of synthetic data, we show how each data set contains complementary important information of the supra and sub-basalt structure. While separate inversions of individual datasets fail to image through the basalt layer, our joint inversion approach leads to a much improved sub-basalt structure. Application of the joint inversion algorithm to satellite gravity data and MT data acquired on the FLARE10 seismic line south west of Faroe islands supports the existence of a 1??km to 2??km thick low velocity region that might be indicative of the existence of a sedimentary basin underneath the basalt layer. Though in this paper we demonstrate the use of joint inversion on a sub-basalt target, we believe it has wider applicability to other areas where conventional seismic imaging fails. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

MATLAB has several useful toolboxes to solve complex problems in various fields of science, such as geophysics. In geophysics, the inversion of 2D DC resistivity imaging data is complex due to its non-linearity, especially for high resistivity contrast regions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of MATLAB to design, train and test a newly developed artificial neural network in inverting 2D DC resistivity imaging data. We used resilient propagation to train the network. The model used to produce synthetic data is a homogeneous medium of 100 ?? m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000 ?? m. The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD. The network was trained using 21 datasets and tested on another 16 synthetic datasets, as well as on real field data. In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing. Three different electrode spacings were measured, which gave a dataset of 330 data points. The interpreted result shows that the trained network was able to invert 2D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by a Wenner-Schlumberger configuration rapidly and accurately. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Time-lapse geophysical monitoring and inversion are valuable tools in hydrogeology for monitoring changes in the subsurface due to natural and forced (tracer) dynamics. However, the resulting models may suffer from insufficient resolution, which leads to underestimated variability and poor mass recovery. Structural joint inversion using cross-gradient constraints can provide higher-resolution models compared with individual inversions and we present the first application to time-lapse data. The results from a synthetic and field vadose zone water tracer injection experiment show that joint 3-D time-lapse inversion of crosshole electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) traveltime data significantly improve the imaged characteristics of the point injected plume, such as lateral spreading and center of mass, as well as the overall consistency between models. The joint inversion method appears to work well for cases when one hydrological state variable (in this case moisture content) controls the time-lapse response of both geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most learning algorithms, including ANN, are designed for well-balanced data and do not work properly on imbalanced ones. Of the approaches proposed for dealing with this problem, we are interested in the re-sampling ones, since they are algorithm-independent. We have recently proposed a new under-sampling technique for the two-class problem, called Non-Target Incremental Learning (NTIL), which has shown a good performance with SVM, improving results and training speed. Here, the advantages of using this technique with ANN are shown. The performance with regard to other popular under-sampling techniques is compared.},

	abstract = {An extensive study of the resistivity structure of the Hengill area in SW Iceland was carried out by the combined use of TEM and MT soundings. Joint inversion of the collected data can correct for static shifts in the MT data, which can be severe due to large near-surface resistivity contrasts. Joint 1D inversion of 148 TEM/MT sounding pairs and a 3D inversion of a 60 sounding subset of the MT data were performed. The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100-240 ??C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3-10 km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We specifically discuss, in detail, neuromorphic designs including spiking neural network hardware, cellular neural network implementations, reconfigurable FPGA based implementations, in particular, for stochastic ANN models, and optical implementations. Parallel digital implementations employing bit-slice, systolic, and SIMD architectures, implementations for associative neural memories, and RAM based implementations are also outlined.

	abstract = {Seismic methods continue to receive interest for use in mineral exploration due to the much higher resolution potential of seismic data compared to the techniques traditionally used, namely, gravity, magnetics, resistivity, and electromagnetics. However, the complicated geology often encountered in hard-rock exploration can make data processing and interpretation difficult. Inverting seismic data jointly with a complementary data set can help overcome these difficulties and facilitate the construction of a common earth model. We considered the joint inversion of seismic first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data to recover causative slowness and density distributions. Our joint inversion algorithm differs from previous work by (1) incorporating a large suite of measures for coupling the two physical property models, (2) slowly increasing the effect of the coupling to help avoid potential convergence issues, and (3) automatically adjusting two Tikhonov tradeoff parameters to achieve a desired fit to both data sets. The coupling measures used are both compositional and structural in nature and allow the inclusion of explicitly known or implicitly assumed empirical relationships, physical property distribution information, and cross-gradient structural coupling. For any particular exploration scenario, the combination of coupling measures used should be guided by the geologic knowledge available. We performed our inversions on unstructured grids comprised of triangular cells in 2D, or tetrahedral cells in 3D, but the joint inversion methods are equally applicable to rectilinear grids. We tested our joint inversion methodology on scenarios based on the Voisey's Bay massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada. These scenarios present a challenge to the inversion of first-arrival traveltimes and we show how joint inversion with gravity data can improve recovery of the subsurface features.},

The main exploration targets are the top of the fractured Precambrian crystalline basement and any concealed basement grabens, the overlying presalt and salt/carbonate deposits, and the postsalt cover deposits. The results of joint inversion clearly mapped the various units and are a significant improvement over previous models derived from separate 2D seismic reflection processing and 2D magnetotelluric imaging. Additionally, multispectral fusion of these models resulted in a single image that permits highly constrained geologic interpretations enabling a better understanding of basin architecture.

More importantly, we examine the reliability of velocity-conductivity relationships derived from structure-coupled joint inversion approaches. Comparison with a seismic reflection section shows that our models match the upper limit of the salt. Furthermore, velocity and resistivity logs from a borehole drilled into the salt dome's flank match, within error, those recovered by the inversion. The good match suggests that the difference in length scale does not have a significant effect in this case. This provides a strong incentive to incorporate borehole data into the joint inversion in the future and substantiates approaches that use the relationships derived from joint inversion models for lithological classification.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

	abstract = {The fracture porosity is estimated especially through the log data (density, neutron porosity and transit time) and the characteristics of the mud (fluid density, transit time of the saturating fluid). If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

Artificial neural networks have been successfully employed in solving complex problems in various fields such as function approximation, pattern association and pattern recognition, associative memories and generation of new meaningful pattern. Comparison of regression and artificial neural network models have shown that the performance values of the artificial neural network models are better than the regression models.

	abstract = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are a powerful mechanism for pattern recognition. Aiming at enhancing their learning capabilities, Multi-valued Probabilistic Logic Nodes (M-PLN) are used, instead of crisp neurons with a 0/1 based RAM-nodes. An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85{\%} based on digital airborne videography. Rond{\^{o}}nia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rond{\^{o}}nia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2{\%}, increasing to 3{\%} by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18{\%} and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rond{\^{o}}nia (Ji-Paran{\'{a}}), deforestation rates rose from 1.2{\%} between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2{\%} in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5{\%} but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3{\%} in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paran{\'{a}} and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

These measurements are generated continuously and in a very high fluctuating data rates. Examples include sensor networks, web logs, and computer network traffic. The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. Algorithms, systems and frameworks that address streaming challenges have been developed over the past three years. In this review paper, we present the state-of-the-art in this growing vital field.},

Previous studies show that sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear significantly influence the formation and frequent changes of tropical cyclones. This paper presents the utilization of a new approach, data mining, to discover the collective contributions to tropical cyclones from sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear, and zonal stretching deformation. A decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm was generated to illustrate the influence of geophysical parameters on the formation of tropical cyclone in weighted correlations. From the decision tree, we also induced decision rules to reveal the quantitative regularities and co-effects of [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear], [atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear], [sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], and other combinations to tropical cyclone formation. The research improved previous findings in (1) preparing more precise criteria for future tropical cyclone prediction, and (2) applying data mining algorithms in studying tropical cyclones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

	abstract = {Large magnitude earthquakes in urban environments continue to kill and injure tens to hundreds of thousands of people, inflicting lasting societal and economic disasters. Earthquake early warning (EEW) provides seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people to move to safe zones and automated slowdown and shutdown of transit and other machinery. The handful of EEW systems operating around the world use traditional seismic and geodetic networks that exist only in a few nations. Smartphones are much more prevalent than traditional networks and contain accelerometers that can also be used to detect earthquakes. We report on the development of a new type of seismic system, MyShake, that harnesses personal/private smartphone sensors to collect data and analyze earthquakes. We show that smartphones can record magnitude 5 earthquakes at distances of 10 km or less and develop an on-phone detection capability to separate earthquakes from other everyday shakes. Our proof-of-concept system then collects earthquake data at a central site where a network detection algorithm confirms that an earthquake is under way and estimates the location and magnitude in real time. This information can then be used to issue an alert of forthcoming ground shaking. MyShake could be used to enhance EEW in regions with traditional networks and could provide the only EEW capability in regions without. In addition, the seismic waveforms recorded could be used to deliver rapid microseism maps, study impacts on buildings, and possibly image shallow earth structure and earthquake rupture kinematics.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.

Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core.

	abstract = {The set of geological elements that control the petroleum existence and distribution in the sedimentary basins are integrated under the concept of petroleum systems. Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

	abstract = {The principal in situ stresses are used to analyze the borehole problems such as fracturing, lost circulation, collapse, and sand production. Potential exists to minimize borehole problems by planning wellbore trajectory and orientation, the directions of perforations, and by implementing leak-off tests. Wellbore instabilities, while drilling or during completion and operation, are the consequence of many phenomena and several factors. These include solid–fluid interaction (between rock materials and drilling fluid), challenging and complex stress conditions, wellbore deviation and multiplicity, irregular formation reservoir behavior, inconsistency or lack of appropriate drilling and operating practices, deep-water operation, and high-pressure high-temperature reservoirs. In this chapter, we will discuss the first three phenomena in detail with the key focus on the main borehole failure mechanisms, that is, fracturing and collapse. We will show how the methods and data of the previous chapters are used to analyze borehole instability problems.}

@article{Anazi2010,
	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

	abstract = {Equivalent staggered grid scheme (ESG) is a new family of schemes based on the finite-difference method (FDM). The method is applied to acoustic wave propagation in variable density media and the results are compared with those from some classic FDM approaches. The main feature of this new family is that it is designed to generate results numerically equivalent to those using the standard staggered grid formulations (SSG), but with the same memory requirements of simple grid schemes. Hence, it results in a reduction of memory usage by 33{\%} in 2D and 50{\%} in 3D problems, compared to the memory usage of SSG. The first-order system of equations in terms of pressure and velocity is not used here. Instead, the formulation is based on applying new central difference operators to the second-order acoustic wave equation in terms of pressure, obtaining the same level of accuracy and stability as the SSG schemes. The equivalence between the ESG and SSG is mathematically demonstrated and issues concerning the application of seismic sources and the boundary conditions are addressed.},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) models for estimating and modelling of daily global solar radiation have been developed. The data used in this work are the global irradiation HG, diffuse irradiation HD, air temperature T and relative humidity Hu. These data are available from 1998 to 2002 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) website. We have developed six ANN-models by using different combination as inputs: the air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration and the day of year. For each model, the output is the daily global solar radiation. Firstly, a set of 4 ?? 365 points (4 years) has been used for training each networks, while a set of 365 points (1 year) has been used for testing and validating the ANN-models. It was found that the model using sunshine duration and air temperature as inputs, gives good accurate results since the correlation coefficient is 97.65{\%}. A comparative study between developed ANN-models and conventional regression models is presented in this study. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Together with many other disciplines, machine learning methods have been widely employed in bioinformatics. The difficulties and cost of biological analyses have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches for this application area. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning and types of classification. Then, we point out the main issues of designing machine learning experiments and their performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce some supervised learning methods.},

@article{Carneiro2012,
	abstract = {A self-organizing map (SOM) approach has been used to provide an integrated spatial analysis and classification of airborne geophysical data collected over the Brazilian Amazon. Magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data were used to extract geophysical signatures related to the spatial distribution of rock types and to produce a geologic map over the prospective Anapu-Tuer{\^{e}} region. Particular emphasis was given to discriminating and identifying rock types, and the processes related to gold mineralization, which are known to occur in the Anapu-Tuer{\^{e}} region. SOM was able to identify and map distinctive geophysical signatures related to the various geologic units identified on the published geologic map. Furthermore, SOM was able to identify and enhance very subtle signatures derived jointly from the magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data that could be related to geologic processes present in the area. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using SOM as a tool for geophysical data analysis and for semiautomated mapping in regions such as the Amazon. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

@article{Carreira2013,
	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

@article{Chakravarthy1999,
	abstract = {Delineation of bed boundaries is one of the important aspects of petrophysical interpretation. Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

@article{Chen2006,
	abstract = {This study integrates log-derived empirical formulas and the concept of the committee machine to develop an improved model for predicting permeability. A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones.

	abstract = {Convinced by the predictive quality of artificial neural network (ANN) models in ecology, we have turned our interests to their explanatory capacities. Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses thermal maturation of organic matter near a well-dated intrusion in the DSDP 41-368 hole near Cape Verde Rise, eastern Atlantic, and near some other intrusions from the U.K., U.S.A. and east Greenland. The traditional numerical model with instantaneous intrusion satisfactorily describes the thermal evolution and thermal maturity aureoles of igneous bodies only if the initial temperature of intrusion is close to or even lower than the solidus temperature. Calculations in this model with more real values of the intrusion temperature and with consideration of latent heat effects lead to considerable over-estimation of thermal influence of the intrusion. Models which consider formation of the intrusive body over time (as distinct from instantaneous intrusion), and especially models of emplacement of an intrusive body in the shell of relatively cool magmatic rocks, show better agreement between the computed and observed vitrinite reflectance profiles. Consideration of convective heat flow due to hydrothermal activity arising in the vicinity of the intrusion during its formation and cooling helps to explain the difference between maturation profiles above and below some sills.}

	abstract = {The influence of igneous intrusions on the trend of thermal maturity with depth in two drillholes, one on Ellesmere Island and the other on Ellef Ringnes Island, Arctic Canada, was assessed using vitrinite and solid bitumen reflectance, Rock-Eval pyrolysis/TOC, and gas composition analysis in order to assess the impact of igneous intrusions on the hydrocarbon system in the area. Thick sequences of Permo-Pennsylvanian strata in Sabine Peninsula, Melville Island, were intruded by two igneous intrusions in the Panarctic Chads Creek B-64 (influenced by one intrusion) and the Panarctic Drake Point D-68 (influenced by two intrusions). Sedimentary strata in Chads Creek B-64 were intruded by a 120 m-thick diabase sill (with temperature of ~1100 °C) of unknown age. This resulted in increased reflectance of vitrinite from 0.90% to 1.65% and of pyrobitumen from 2.90% to almost 5.80% near the sill contact at depth of 3600 m. Solid bitumen outside of the thermal aureole zones and having reflectance values <1.50% followed the extrapolated trend for solid bitumen present in the country rocks. In Panarctic Drake Point D-68, the intrusives are granodiorite sills of 45 m and 75 m thickness and were emplaced during the Upper Jurassic (152 Ma) and Lower Cretaceous (131 Ma). The intrusion temperature was 800 °C. The Vitrinite Rr prior to sill emplacement was <1.0% outside the aureole and increased to approximately 2.0% near the intrusive zone. The rocks were well-lithified prior to sill emplacement. Solid bitumen underwent carbonization after being exposed to a temperature of at least 800 °C. Solid bitumen reflectance also showed a sudden increase from a minimum of 1.50% outside the aureole to approximately 7.0% near the sill contact, a 5× increase as compared to an increase of 2× for vitrinite. This indicates that solid bitumen is a very sensitive indicator of temperature variation, more sensitive than vitrinite. Solid bitumen reflectance prior to the sill emplacement can only be inferred from the solid bitumen below the lower, younger sill because of poor control on solid bitumen in the interval just above the upper, older sill. Reflectance trends above and below the sills appear to be symmetrical despite the superimposition of the effects of one sill on the other. The metamorphic effects of the sill, as determined vertically by the reflectance trend, can be observed for a distance of up to seven times its thickness. The upper, older sill is approximately 45 m thick and the thermal aureole zone above it has a width of 330 m. The thickness of the aureole below the sill is difficult to establish because it has been obliterated by the effect of the lower, younger sill. The thickness of the lower sill is 75 m. An additional factor that influenced solid bitumen reflectance in this case may have been the thickness of the sill, which, in turn, affects the cooling time of the intrusive body. The granodiorite sills are approximately 45–75 m thick and the diabase sill is almost 120 m.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.},

Previous studies show that sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear significantly influence the formation and frequent changes of tropical cyclones. This paper presents the utilization of a new approach, data mining, to discover the collective contributions to tropical cyclones from sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear, and zonal stretching deformation. A decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm was generated to illustrate the influence of geophysical parameters on the formation of tropical cyclone in weighted correlations. From the decision tree, we also induced decision rules to reveal the quantitative regularities and co-effects of [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear], [atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear], [sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], and other combinations to tropical cyclone formation. The research improved previous findings in (1) preparing more precise criteria for future tropical cyclone prediction, and (2) applying data mining algorithms in studying tropical cyclones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The wireline well logs used are sonic, gamma ray, neutron porosity, bulk density and resistivity. We solve this inverse problem in a predictive Bayesian setting, and perform the associated model parameter estimation. Spatial vertical structure of the facies is included in the model by a Markov chain assumption, making geological model interpretation possible. We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect. Results from a blind well indicate that facies predictions from our model are more reliable than predictions from the naive model in terms of correct facies classification and predicted layer thickness.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural systems have been used in a variety of problems in the fields of science and engineering. Here we describe a study of the applicability of neural networks to solving some geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we study the problem of obtaining formation resistivities and layer thicknesses from vertical electrical sounding (VES) data and that of obtaining 1D velocity models from seismic waveform data. We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

	abstract={AbstractHole problems during the drilling phase of operations are often the consequence of mechanical wellbore instability. This leads to higher than necessary drilling costs. A linear-elastic analysis is frequently proposed for the prediction of the onset of failure, and consequently the mud weights required to prevent hole instability. However, there is no clear choice of which compressive failure criterion to use in the analysis. This paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed failure criteria on mud weight selection. The failure criteria selected is shown to have an extremely significant effect on the computed 'safe' mud weights. Examples related to field situations are presented which highlight the anomalies and contrary evidence relating to the suitability of failure criteria. IntroductionThe increasing demand for wellbore stability analyses during the planning stage of a field arises from economic considerations and the escalating use of deviated, extended reach and horizontal wells. Wellbore instability can result in lost circulation (Figure la) where tensile failure has occurred, and spalling and/or hole closure (Figure lb) in the case of compressive failure. In severe cases the hole instability can lead to stuck pipe and eventually loss of the open hole section. The causes of instability are often classified into either chemical or mechanical effects. Often, field instances of instability are a result of a combination of both chemical and mechanical effects. However, only mechanical effects are considered here. Due to the large costs associated with wellbore instability this subject has received considerable attention in the literature over the past two decades ([l] to [161). The majority of the literature focuses on analytical aspects of wellbore stability. In a previous publication [151 the authors reviewed strength criteria used in many of the models published and showed that certain criteria do not stand up to close scrutiny when compared with laboratory strength test data. In this paper the effect of strength criteria on mud weight selection is highlighted to show some of the anomalies and contrary evidence which can make the choice of a strength criterion difficult and confusing when performing wellbore stability analyses. 2.0 BACKGROUND TO WELLBORE STABILITY MODELLING Before a well is drilled, compressive stresses exist within the rock formations (Figure 2). With the exception of structurally complex areas (e.g. near salt diapirs), the in-situ stresses can be resolved into a vertical or overburden stress, , and two horizontal stresses, (the maximum horizontal stress), and (the minimum horizontal stress), which are generally unequal. When the well is drilled, the rock stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore are redistributed as the support originally offered by the drilled out rock is replaced by the hydraulic pressure of the mud. pressure of the mud.

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

	abstract = {The general relationship of Erich Stach's research work to the effects of igneous activity on organic maturation is briefly considered. The geological history of the Midland Valley of Scotland is then reviewed. As a graben which developed in Devonian (Old Red Sandstone) times, and continued to do so as lithospheric tensional stretching was maintained throughout the Carboniferous, a significant factor in relation to the development of organic maturation was the widespread igneous activity that persisted throughout much of Upper Palaeozoic times. Calc-alkaline volcanic rocks are a major feature within the molasse-type deposits of the Old Red Sandstone. After a period of quiescence in later Old Red Sandstone times, the continuing tensional stretching initiated or rejuvenated major crustal fractures. Extensive volcanic, sill and dyke activity exercised an important influence on the predominantly shallow-water deltaic deposits of the Carboniferous. Alkaline-olivine basalts were erupted in the Early Carboniferous, while volcanic activity in the later Carboniferous was essentially phreatic. Two major intrusive episodes occurred; the first of alkaline sills in Early to mid-Carboniferous times which were closely related to volcanic plugs and eruptive centres, the second in post-Westphalian times when tholeiitic sills and dykes with no known relationships with any extrusive rocks were injected. The effects of this igneous activity on organic maturation can be considered under four headings. 1.(1) Although the general development of maturation of Carboniferous organic matter, which includes many coal seams and oil shales, was controlled to some degree by burial history, the regional pattern of igneous activity was also influential. Thus, there is a gradual increase of coalification from east to west in the Midland Valley which corresponds with an increasing thickness of volcanic pile in the central and westerly parts of the graben, suggesting that there may have been a greater regional “heat sink” in the west during the Carboniferous. The level of coalification is nowhere particularly high, except where affected by intrusions, and regional reflectance gradients generally vary between %Roil (vitrinite) = 0.2/km to 0.4/km, without displaying any consistent pattern.2.(2) The post-Westphalian tholeiitic (quartz-dolerite) Midland Valley Sill, which underlies most of the central and eastern parts of the graben, has produced extensive reflectance (thermal) aureoles in the organic matter above and below the intrusion. The olivine-dolerite and teschenite sills of Namurian—early Westphalian times, many of similar thickness to the quartz-dolerite intrusions, fail to produce significant reflectance (thermal) aureoles. This major difference in organic matter response to the intrusions can only be explained in terms of the initial rank level of the organic matter, differences in degree of compaction of the sediments and particularly in the amount of water the sediments contained at the time of intrusion.3.(3) Maturation of organic matter closely associated with extensive Surtseyan-type volcanic activity in the eastern part of the graben displays no relationship to the regionally developed coalification in associated sediments. Although some vitrinite clasts in the pyroclastic deposits have had their reflectances raised to meta-anthracitic rank, reflectance levels of clasts in tuffs and agglomerates are generally not much raised above the regional reflectance level, suggesting incorporation of organic matter in ash streams in which water was an important cooling and protective component.4.(4) The close relationship of organic matter of all kinds with volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks has led to a marked increase of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the aromatic fractions of organic extracts. The source of these hydrocarbons is the combustion and/ or pyrolysis of organic matter caused by the high temperatures of the igneous materials, whether volcanic or intrusive. These PAH may be directly generated or absorbed from the surrounding environment.}

	abstract = {MATLAB is a high-level matrix/array language with control flow statements and functions. MATLAB has several useful toolboxes to solve complex problems in various fields of science, such as geophysics. In geophysics, the inversion of 2D DC resistivity imaging data is complex due to its non-linearity, especially for high resistivity contrast regions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of MATLAB to design, train and test a newly developed artificial neural network in inverting 2D DC resistivity imaging data. We used resilient propagation to train the network. The model used to produce synthetic data is a homogeneous medium of 100 ?? m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000 ?? m. The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD. The network was trained using 21 datasets and tested on another 16 synthetic datasets, as well as on real field data. In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing. Three different electrode spacings were measured, which gave a dataset of 330 data points. The interpreted result shows that the trained network was able to invert 2D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by a Wenner-Schlumberger configuration rapidly and accurately. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are a powerful mechanism for pattern recognition. Aiming at enhancing their learning capabilities, Multi-valued Probabilistic Logic Nodes (M-PLN) are used, instead of crisp neurons with a 0/1 based RAM-nodes. An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

Most learning algorithms, including ANN, are designed for well-balanced data and do not work properly on imbalanced ones. Of the approaches proposed for dealing with this problem, we are interested in the re-sampling ones, since they are algorithm-independent. We have recently proposed a new under-sampling technique for the two-class problem, called Non-Target Incremental Learning (NTIL), which has shown a good performance with SVM, improving results and training speed. Here, the advantages of using this technique with ANN are shown. The performance with regard to other popular under-sampling techniques is compared.},

Formation damage refers to the changes in the producing formation that leads to decline in coal permeability which eventually leads to the decline in production. This chapter discusses the various mechanisms in the reservoir that lead to formation damage. It describes and discusses the major types of formation damage that commonly occur when drilling CBM reservoirs. The emphasis is on the most common types of formation damage, that are those associated with drilling, completion, and specifically hydraulic fracturing.

The main problems arising in the process of the factor space division into the test, validation and training sets were formulated. An approach based on the use of clustering that allowed to increase the entropy of the training set was put forward. Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) were examined as an effective clustering procedure. Based on such maps, the clustering of factor spaces of different dimensions was carried out, and a representative sample was formed. To verify our approach we synthesized the MLP neural network and trained it. The training technique was performed with the sets formed both with and without clustering. The approach under consideration was concluded to have an influence on the increase in the entropy of the training set and (as a result) to lead to the quality improvement of MLP training with the small dimension of the factor space.},

	abstract = {A methodology to generate synthetic wireline logs is presented. Synthetic logs can help to analyze the reservoir properties in areas where the set of logs that are necessary, are absent or incomplete. The approach presented involves the use of artificial neural networks as the main tool, in conjunction with data obtained from conventional wireline logs. Implementation of this approach aims to reduce costs to companies. Development of the neural network model was completed using Generalized Regression Neural Network, and wireline logs from four wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, and resistivity logs. Synthetic logs were generated through two different exercises. Exercise one involved all four wells for training, calibration and verification process. The second exercise used three wells for training and calibration and the fourth well was used for verification. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, three different combinations of inputs/outputs were chosen to train the network. In combination "A" the resistivity log was the output and density, gamma ray, and neutron logs, and the coordinates and depths (XYZ) the inputs. In combination "B" the density log was output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the neutron logs, and XYZ were the inputs, and in combination "C" the neutron log was the output while the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the density logs, and XYZ were the inputs. After development of the neural network model, synthetic logs with a reasonable degree of accuracy were generated. Results indicate that the best performance was obtained for combination "A" of inputs and outputs, then for combination "C", and finally for combination "B". In addition, it was determined that accuracy of synthetic logs is favored by interpolation of data. It was also demonstrated that using neural network to generate synthetic well logs is far more superior when compared to conventional approaches such as multiple-regression. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {As geophysicists, we are trained to conceptualize geophysical problems in detail. However, machine learning algorithms are more difficult to understand and are often thought of as simply “black boxes.” A numerical example is used here to illustrate the difference between geophysical inversion and inversion by machine learning. In doing so, an attempt is made to demystify machine learning algorithms and show that, like inverse problems, they have a definite mathematical structure that can be written down and understood. The example used is the extraction of the underlying reflection coefficients from a synthetic seismic response that was created by convolving a reflection coefficient dipole with a symmetric wavelet. Because the dipole is below the seismic tuning frequency, the overlapping wavelets create both an amplitude increase and extra nonphysical reflection coefficients in the synthetic seismic data. This is a common problem in real seismic data. In discussing the solution to this problem, the topics of deconvolution, recursive inversion, linear regression, and nonlinear regression using a feedforward neural network are covered. It is shown that if the inputs to the deconvolution problem are fully understood, this is the optimal way to extract the true reflection coefficients. However, if the geophysics is not fully understood and large amounts of data are available, machine learning can provide a viable alternative to geophysical inversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Effective characterization of lithology is vital for the conceptualization of complex aquifer systems, which is a prerequisite for the development of reliable groundwater-flow and contaminant-transport models. However, such information is often limited for most groundwater basins. This study explores the usefulness and potential of a hybrid soft-computing framework; a traditional artificial neural network with gradient descent-momentum training (ANN-GDM) and a traditional genetic algorithm (GA) based ANN (ANN-GA) approach were developed and compared with a novel hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) based ANN (SOM-ANN-GA) method for the prediction of lithology at a basin scale. This framework is demonstrated through a case study involving a complex multi-layered aquifer system in India, where well-log sites were clustered on the basis of sand-layer frequencies; within each cluster, subsurface layers were reclassified into four depth classes based on the maximum drilling depth. ANN models for each depth class were developed using each of the three approaches. Of the three, the hybrid SOM-ANN-GA models were able to recognize incomplete geologic pattern more reasonably, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-GDM models. It is concluded that the hybrid soft-computing framework can serve as a promising tool for characterizing lithology in groundwater basins with missing lithologic patterns.},

	abstract = {Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90{\%} accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.},

The westernmost IS-type Acre Basin is interpreted as a retro arc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis (Jordan, 1995). Continental sediments filled a syneclisis from the Carboniferous until the Jurassic, with rocks of marine to continental environment followed by a flexure in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. East of this basin and separated from it by the Iquitos Arch, the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is internally divided in two by the Carauari Arch. It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. This IF-type basin is an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border between Brazil and Guyana, covering some 4,500 km2 of the Brazilian territory. Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

	abstract = {Accurate interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data in the presence of static shift arising from near-surface inhomogeneities is an unresolved problem in three-dimensional (3-D) inversion. While it is well known in 1-D and 2-D studies that static shift can lead to erroneous interpretation, how static shift can influence the result of 3-D inversion is not fully understood and is relevant to improved subsurface analysis. Using the synthetic data generated from 3-D models with randomly distributed heterogeneous overburden and elongate homogeneous overburden that are consistent with geological observations, this paper examines the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity on the accuracy of 3-D inversion models. It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to study the use of a decision tree$\backslash$nclassifier and multiscale texture measures to extract thematic$\backslash$ninformation on the tropical vegetation cover from the Global Rain Forest$\backslash$nMapping (GRFM) JERS-1 SAR mosaics. The authors focus their study on a$\backslash$ncoastal region of Gabon, which has a variety of land cover types common$\backslash$nto most tropical regions. A decision tree classifier does not assume a$\backslash$nparticular probability density distribution of the input data, and is$\backslash$nthus well adapted for SAR image classification. A total of seven$\backslash$nfeatures, including wavelet-based multiscale texture measures (at scales$\backslash$nof 200, 400, and 800 m) and multiscale multitemporal amplitude data (two$\backslash$ndates at scales 100 and 400 m), are used to discriminate the land cover$\backslash$nclasses of interest. Among these layers, the best features for$\backslash$nseparating classes are found by constructing exploratory decision trees$\backslash$nfrom various feature combinations. The decision tree structure stability$\backslash$nis then investigated by interchanging the role of the training samples$\backslash$nfor decision tree growth and testing. They show that the construction of$\backslash$nexploratory decision trees can improve the classification results. The$\backslash$nanalysis also proves that the radar backscatter amplitude is important$\backslash$nfor separating basic land cover categories such as savannas, forests,$\backslash$nand flooded vegetation. Texture is found to be useful for refining$\backslash$nflooded vegetation classes. Temporal information from SAR images of two$\backslash$ndifferent dates is explicitly used in the decision tree structure to$\backslash$nidentify swamps and temporarily flooded vegetation},

@article{Valentin2019,
	abstract = {Field characterization in oil industry is a challenging task which aims to determine or estimate some of the petrophysical properties of a reservoir. These properties are expected to be later used in a non-deterministic workflow (which might depend on subjective interpretations carried out by each petrophysicist) whose aim is to answer questions such as whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. Three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. Obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. Hence, it is common to use other tools (such as wirelogging tools or borehole imagers) to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at which no core sample could be extracted. In this context, estimating lithofacies helps petrophysicists to automatize the process of identifying the lithology of the reservoir. Previous work (Basu et al., 2002; Chai et al., 2009; Linek et al., 2007; Newberry et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1996) used a considerable amount of wirelog data and borehole image logs to induce the lithology of the reservoir. In the work presented in this paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatic reservoir lithofacies identification. Our model relies only on ultrasonic and microresistivity borehole image logs as inputs, which are characterized by a deep residual convolutional network which then infers the probability of each sample to be classified as each type of previously defined lithofacies classes. The method presented in this work was tested on a carbonate well from the Brazilian pre-salt oilfields, and it allowed us to obtain an average classification accuracy of 81.45{\%} and an average area under the ROC curve of 92.70{\%} for all classes, for the blind test sample.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Yang2009,
	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

	abstract = {Part I attempts to review the background, basic sources of data, concepts, and methodology to be employed in the study of perceptrons. In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

	abstract = {Equivalent staggered grid scheme (ESG) is a new family of schemes based on the finite-difference method (FDM). The method is applied to acoustic wave propagation in variable density media and the results are compared with those from some classic FDM approaches. The main feature of this new family is that it is designed to generate results numerically equivalent to those using the standard staggered grid formulations (SSG), but with the same memory requirements of simple grid schemes. Hence, it results in a reduction of memory usage by 33{\%} in 2D and 50{\%} in 3D problems, compared to the memory usage of SSG. The first-order system of equations in terms of pressure and velocity is not used here. Instead, the formulation is based on applying new central difference operators to the second-order acoustic wave equation in terms of pressure, obtaining the same level of accuracy and stability as the SSG schemes. The equivalence between the ESG and SSG is mathematically demonstrated and issues concerning the application of seismic sources and the boundary conditions are addressed.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90{\%} accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.},

	abstract = {The set of geological elements that control the petroleum existence and distribution in the sedimentary basins are integrated under the concept of petroleum systems. Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

Here we describe a study of the applicability of neural networks to solving some geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we study the problem of obtaining formation resistivities and layer thicknesses from vertical electrical sounding (VES) data and that of obtaining 1D velocity models from seismic waveform data. We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as approximately 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404+/-8 Myr--about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O values from 7.4 to 5.0{\%}), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high delta18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a delta18O value from 8.5 to 9.5{\%}. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

However, machine learning algorithms are more difficult to understand and are often thought of as simply “black boxes.” A numerical example is used here to illustrate the difference between geophysical inversion and inversion by machine learning. In doing so, an attempt is made to demystify machine learning algorithms and show that, like inverse problems, they have a definite mathematical structure that can be written down and understood. The example used is the extraction of the underlying reflection coefficients from a synthetic seismic response that was created by convolving a reflection coefficient dipole with a symmetric wavelet. Because the dipole is below the seismic tuning frequency, the overlapping wavelets create both an amplitude increase and extra nonphysical reflection coefficients in the synthetic seismic data. This is a common problem in real seismic data. In discussing the solution to this problem, the topics of deconvolution, recursive inversion, linear regression, and nonlinear regression using a feedforward neural network are covered. It is shown that if the inputs to the deconvolution problem are fully understood, this is the optimal way to extract the true reflection coefficients. However, if the geophysics is not fully understood and large amounts of data are available, machine learning can provide a viable alternative to geophysical inversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, a methodology based exclusively on the analysis of 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation responses – using data mining algorithms – is evaluated to perform the automatic classification of carbonate samples according to their rock type.

	abstract = {Field characterization in oil industry is a challenging task which aims to determine or estimate some of the petrophysical properties of a reservoir. These properties are expected to be later used in a non-deterministic workflow (which might depend on subjective interpretations carried out by each petrophysicist) whose aim is to answer questions such as whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. Three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. Obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. Hence, it is common to use other tools (such as wirelogging tools or borehole imagers) to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at which no core sample could be extracted. In this context, estimating lithofacies helps petrophysicists to automatize the process of identifying the lithology of the reservoir. Previous work (Basu et al., 2002; Chai et al., 2009; Linek et al., 2007; Newberry et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1996) used a considerable amount of wirelog data and borehole image logs to induce the lithology of the reservoir. In the work presented in this paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatic reservoir lithofacies identification. Our model relies only on ultrasonic and microresistivity borehole image logs as inputs, which are characterized by a deep residual convolutional network which then infers the probability of each sample to be classified as each type of previously defined lithofacies classes. The method presented in this work was tested on a carbonate well from the Brazilian pre-salt oilfields, and it allowed us to obtain an average classification accuracy of 81.45{\%} and an average area under the ROC curve of 92.70{\%} for all classes, for the blind test sample.},

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Effective characterization of lithology is vital for the conceptualization of complex aquifer systems, which is a prerequisite for the development of reliable groundwater-flow and contaminant-transport models. However, such information is often limited for most groundwater basins. This study explores the usefulness and potential of a hybrid soft-computing framework; a traditional artificial neural network with gradient descent-momentum training (ANN-GDM) and a traditional genetic algorithm (GA) based ANN (ANN-GA) approach were developed and compared with a novel hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) based ANN (SOM-ANN-GA) method for the prediction of lithology at a basin scale. This framework is demonstrated through a case study involving a complex multi-layered aquifer system in India, where well-log sites were clustered on the basis of sand-layer frequencies; within each cluster, subsurface layers were reclassified into four depth classes based on the maximum drilling depth. ANN models for each depth class were developed using each of the three approaches. Of the three, the hybrid SOM-ANN-GA models were able to recognize incomplete geologic pattern more reasonably, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-GDM models. It is concluded that the hybrid soft-computing framework can serve as a promising tool for characterizing lithology in groundwater basins with missing lithologic patterns.},

Particular emphasis was given to discriminating and identifying rock types, and the processes related to gold mineralization, which are known to occur in the Anapu-Tuer{\^{e}} region. SOM was able to identify and map distinctive geophysical signatures related to the various geologic units identified on the published geologic map. Furthermore, SOM was able to identify and enhance very subtle signatures derived jointly from the magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data that could be related to geologic processes present in the area.

	abstract = {Pattern recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a black box that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (x, y, and z) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a SOM model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decomposition algorithm to capture the sedimentary cycle pattern as an attribute. If we correlate this attribute to the training data, it will favor SOM facies maps that follow stratigraphy. We apply this workflow to a Barnett Shale data set and find that the constrained SOM facies map shows layers that are easily overlooked on traditional unconstrained SOM facies map.},

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Northern Amazon Province there is a succession of IS- or IF/IS-type sedimentary basins along the Solim{\~{o}}es/Amazonas river. The westernmost IS-type Acre Basin is interpreted as a retro arc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis (Jordan, 1995). Continental sediments filled a syneclisis from the Carboniferous until the Jurassic, with rocks of marine to continental environment followed by a flexure in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. East of this basin and separated from it by the Iquitos Arch, the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is internally divided in two by the Carauari Arch. It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. This IF-type basin is an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border between Brazil and Guyana, covering some 4,500 km2 of the Brazilian territory. Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. IS-type Cenozoic fluvial and lacustrine clastics of the Solim{\~{o}}es and Boa Vista basins were unconformably deposited above these basins. The former basin occupies a wide area of the Western Amazonia and the latter surrounds},

	abstract = {Accurate interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data in the presence of static shift arising from near-surface inhomogeneities is an unresolved problem in three-dimensional (3-D) inversion. While it is well known in 1-D and 2-D studies that static shift can lead to erroneous interpretation, how static shift can influence the result of 3-D inversion is not fully understood and is relevant to improved subsurface analysis. Using the synthetic data generated from 3-D models with randomly distributed heterogeneous overburden and elongate homogeneous overburden that are consistent with geological observations, this paper examines the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity on the accuracy of 3-D inversion models. It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

	abstract = {A numerical experiment was applied to explore the potentialities and limitations of joint inversion of IP-affected transients measured with different loop configurations above a uniform half-space with a Cole-Cole complex conductivity. One of us calculated 200 m ?? 50 m and 50 m ?? 50 m loop responses of a uniform polarizable conductor with varied Cole-Cole parameters and imposed synthetic Gaussian noise that simulated measurement errors. Then the generated pseudo-experimental data passed to the other co-author who performed single and joint 1D inversion twice: first being unaware of the "true" underlying models and then after being told that they all were represented by a uniform polarizable earth. More than a half of the fitted models provided a good idea of the true models though misfit was quite large in some cases. The fit was better in single inversion with a priori information available, and improved further through joint inversion of central-loop and coincident-loop responses. Joint inversion with a priori information known was of good quality even at a chargeability as low as 0.02. The standard error in joint inversion was times the measurement error and depended mainly on fitting errors for smaller-loop data. The reason is that the smaller-loop transients included a non-monotonous interval where the signal changed rapidly under the effect of fast-decaying induced polarization. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Breakup of the North Atlantic during the early tertiary was accompanied by widespread and massive magmatism, resulting in the coverage of large areas of the North Atlantic with flood basalts. These flood basalts hamper seismic investigations of underlying sequences and thus the understanding of the rifting, subsidence and evolution of the margin which, in turn, increases the risk for hydrocarbon exploration. In this paper we present a methodology for the simultaneous joint inversion of diverse geophysical datasets, i.e. free air gravity and magnetotelluric soundings (MT) using seismic a priori constraints. The attraction of the joint inversion approach is that different geophysical measurements are sensitive to different properties of the sub-surface, so through joint inversion we significantly reduce the null space and produce a single model that fits all datasets within a predefined tolerance. Using sensitivity analysis of synthetic data, we show how each data set contains complementary important information of the supra and sub-basalt structure. While separate inversions of individual datasets fail to image through the basalt layer, our joint inversion approach leads to a much improved sub-basalt structure. Application of the joint inversion algorithm to satellite gravity data and MT data acquired on the FLARE10 seismic line south west of Faroe islands supports the existence of a 1??km to 2??km thick low velocity region that might be indicative of the existence of a sedimentary basin underneath the basalt layer. Though in this paper we demonstrate the use of joint inversion on a sub-basalt target, we believe it has wider applicability to other areas where conventional seismic imaging fails. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

	abstract = {MATLAB is a high-level matrix/array language with control flow statements and functions. MATLAB has several useful toolboxes to solve complex problems in various fields of science, such as geophysics. In geophysics, the inversion of 2D DC resistivity imaging data is complex due to its non-linearity, especially for high resistivity contrast regions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of MATLAB to design, train and test a newly developed artificial neural network in inverting 2D DC resistivity imaging data. We used resilient propagation to train the network. The model used to produce synthetic data is a homogeneous medium of 100 ?? m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000 ?? m. The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD. The network was trained using 21 datasets and tested on another 16 synthetic datasets, as well as on real field data. In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing. Three different electrode spacings were measured, which gave a dataset of 330 data points. The interpreted result shows that the trained network was able to invert 2D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by a Wenner-Schlumberger configuration rapidly and accurately. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Time-lapse geophysical monitoring and inversion are valuable tools in hydrogeology for monitoring changes in the subsurface due to natural and forced (tracer) dynamics. However, the resulting models may suffer from insufficient resolution, which leads to underestimated variability and poor mass recovery. Structural joint inversion using cross-gradient constraints can provide higher-resolution models compared with individual inversions and we present the first application to time-lapse data. The results from a synthetic and field vadose zone water tracer injection experiment show that joint 3-D time-lapse inversion of crosshole electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) traveltime data significantly improve the imaged characteristics of the point injected plume, such as lateral spreading and center of mass, as well as the overall consistency between models. The joint inversion method appears to work well for cases when one hydrological state variable (in this case moisture content) controls the time-lapse response of both geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {An extensive study of the resistivity structure of the Hengill area in SW Iceland was carried out by the combined use of TEM and MT soundings. Joint inversion of the collected data can correct for static shifts in the MT data, which can be severe due to large near-surface resistivity contrasts. Joint 1D inversion of 148 TEM/MT sounding pairs and a 3D inversion of a 60 sounding subset of the MT data were performed. The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100-240 ??C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3-10 km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Seismic methods continue to receive interest for use in mineral exploration due to the much higher resolution potential of seismic data compared to the techniques traditionally used, namely, gravity, magnetics, resistivity, and electromagnetics. However, the complicated geology often encountered in hard-rock exploration can make data processing and interpretation difficult. Inverting seismic data jointly with a complementary data set can help overcome these difficulties and facilitate the construction of a common earth model. We considered the joint inversion of seismic first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data to recover causative slowness and density distributions. Our joint inversion algorithm differs from previous work by (1) incorporating a large suite of measures for coupling the two physical property models, (2) slowly increasing the effect of the coupling to help avoid potential convergence issues, and (3) automatically adjusting two Tikhonov tradeoff parameters to achieve a desired fit to both data sets. The coupling measures used are both compositional and structural in nature and allow the inclusion of explicitly known or implicitly assumed empirical relationships, physical property distribution information, and cross-gradient structural coupling. For any particular exploration scenario, the combination of coupling measures used should be guided by the geologic knowledge available. We performed our inversions on unstructured grids comprised of triangular cells in 2D, or tetrahedral cells in 3D, but the joint inversion methods are equally applicable to rectilinear grids. We tested our joint inversion methodology on scenarios based on the Voisey's Bay massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada. These scenarios present a challenge to the inversion of first-arrival traveltimes and we show how joint inversion with gravity data can improve recovery of the subsurface features.},

The main exploration targets are the top of the fractured Precambrian crystalline basement and any concealed basement grabens, the overlying presalt and salt/carbonate deposits, and the postsalt cover deposits. The results of joint inversion clearly mapped the various units and are a significant improvement over previous models derived from separate 2D seismic reflection processing and 2D magnetotelluric imaging. Additionally, multispectral fusion of these models resulted in a single image that permits highly constrained geologic interpretations enabling a better understanding of basin architecture. We suggest that joint inversion and image fusion is the way forward for effective geophysical integration.},

Such structures are difficult to image with a single method, and our results demonstrate how combining different techniques can yield improved results. More importantly, we examine the reliability of velocity-conductivity relationships derived from structure-coupled joint inversion approaches. Comparison with a seismic reflection section shows that our models match the upper limit of the salt. Furthermore, velocity and resistivity logs from a borehole drilled into the salt dome's flank match, within error, those recovered by the inversion. The good match suggests that the difference in length scale does not have a significant effect in this case. This provides a strong incentive to incorporate borehole data into the joint inversion in the future and substantiates approaches that use the relationships derived from joint inversion models for lithological classification.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

	abstract = {Various models based on regression as well as artificial neural networks have been studied for the estimation of monthly average global solar radiations. Most of the regression models generally used sunshine hour data for the estimation of global solar radiations on the horizontal surfaces, whereas maximum artificial neural network models have used multilayer feed forward network sigmoid trained with Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation algorithm with different input terminals and different hidden layer neurons. Artificial neural networks have been successfully employed in solving complex problems in various fields such as function approximation, pattern association and pattern recognition, associative memories and generation of new meaningful pattern. Comparison of regression and artificial neural network models have shown that the performance values of the artificial neural network models are better than the regression models. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) values of the artificial neural network models are lower than those of the regression models. In addition, the R values of the artificial neural network models are higher than those of regression models. The artificial neural network offers an alternative method which cannot be underestimated.},

	abstract = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are a powerful mechanism for pattern recognition. Aiming at enhancing their learning capabilities, Multi-valued Probabilistic Logic Nodes (M-PLN) are used, instead of crisp neurons with a 0/1 based RAM-nodes. An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85{\%} based on digital airborne videography. Rond{\^{o}}nia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rond{\^{o}}nia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2{\%}, increasing to 3{\%} by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18{\%} and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rond{\^{o}}nia (Ji-Paran{\'{a}}), deforestation rates rose from 1.2{\%} between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2{\%} in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5{\%} but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3{\%} in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paran{\'{a}} and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Together with many other disciplines, machine learning methods have been widely employed in bioinformatics. The difficulties and cost of biological analyses have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches for this application area. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning and types of classification. Then, we point out the main issues of designing machine learning experiments and their performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce some supervised learning methods.},

	abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

@article{Kong2016,
	abstract = {Large magnitude earthquakes in urban environments continue to kill and injure tens to hundreds of thousands of people, inflicting lasting societal and economic disasters. Earthquake early warning (EEW) provides seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people to move to safe zones and automated slowdown and shutdown of transit and other machinery. The handful of EEW systems operating around the world use traditional seismic and geodetic networks that exist only in a few nations. Smartphones are much more prevalent than traditional networks and contain accelerometers that can also be used to detect earthquakes. We report on the development of a new type of seismic system, MyShake, that harnesses personal/private smartphone sensors to collect data and analyze earthquakes. We show that smartphones can record magnitude 5 earthquakes at distances of 10 km or less and develop an on-phone detection capability to separate earthquakes from other everyday shakes. Our proof-of-concept system then collects earthquake data at a central site where a network detection algorithm confirms that an earthquake is under way and estimates the location and magnitude in real time. This information can then be used to issue an alert of forthcoming ground shaking. MyShake could be used to enhance EEW in regions with traditional networks and could provide the only EEW capability in regions without. In addition, the seismic waveforms recorded could be used to deliver rapid microseism maps, study impacts on buildings, and possibly image shallow earth structure and earthquake rupture kinematics.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

	abstract = {Part I attempts to review the background, basic sources of data, concepts, and methodology to be employed in the study of perceptrons. In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

The relation between the training error and the generalization error is studied in terms of the number of the training examples and the complexity of a network which reduces to the number of parameters in the ordinary statistical theory of AIC. This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set.},

	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

	abstract = {A methodology to generate synthetic wireline logs is presented. Synthetic logs can help to analyze the reservoir properties in areas where the set of logs that are necessary, are absent or incomplete. The approach presented involves the use of artificial neural networks as the main tool, in conjunction with data obtained from conventional wireline logs. Implementation of this approach aims to reduce costs to companies. Development of the neural network model was completed using Generalized Regression Neural Network, and wireline logs from four wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, and resistivity logs. Synthetic logs were generated through two different exercises. Exercise one involved all four wells for training, calibration and verification process. The second exercise used three wells for training and calibration and the fourth well was used for verification. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, three different combinations of inputs/outputs were chosen to train the network. In combination "A" the resistivity log was the output and density, gamma ray, and neutron logs, and the coordinates and depths (XYZ) the inputs. In combination "B" the density log was output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the neutron logs, and XYZ were the inputs, and in combination "C" the neutron log was the output while the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the density logs, and XYZ were the inputs. After development of the neural network model, synthetic logs with a reasonable degree of accuracy were generated. Results indicate that the best performance was obtained for combination "A" of inputs and outputs, then for combination "C", and finally for combination "B". In addition, it was determined that accuracy of synthetic logs is favored by interpolation of data. It was also demonstrated that using neural network to generate synthetic well logs is far more superior when compared to conventional approaches such as multiple-regression. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using synthetic data is challenging due to the differences in feature distributions between synthetic and real data, a phenomenon we term synthetic gap. In this paper, we investigate and formalize a general framework - Stacked Multichannel Autoencoder (SMCAE) that enables bridging the synthetic gap and learning from synthetic data more efficiently. In particular, we show that our SMCAE can not only transform and use synthetic data on the challenging face-sketch recognition task, but that it can also help simulate real images, which can be used for training classifiers for recognition. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework.},

	abstract = {When using wireline log to characterize formation properties for an area we often run into incomplete datasets. One way to address this lack of data is to create synthetic curves to use in the analysis. This paper will cover workflows to generate synthetic photoelectric (PE) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) logs. Modern well log data sets usually include PE logs which provides important information about the lithology of the formations the wellbore intersects. However, many legacy wells do not have PE logs that we need in order to understand the lithology of these formations. Similarly, it is important to obtain UCS data from mechanical failure tests done to core samples to determine the strength of the rock. Obtaining and testing core samples for the entire zones of interest is both expensive and time consuming. Synthetic well logs can be a reliable and cheaper alternative to predicting PE and UCS values rather than running a new set of logs or coring and testing the whole zone of interest. In the first workflow, Synthetic PE logs were generated using wireline logs from over a hundred wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, resistivity logs and volume of clay. The data was randomly partitioned into a 70:30 split for training and validation data set respectively. Model competition among a suite of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest was used to select the best algorithm based on the least average squared error (ASE) of the validation dataset. In the second workflow, UCS data was generated using wireline logs and core rebound hammer data from fourteen wells including gamma ray, density, porosity, neutron, clay volume, kerogen volume, compressional slowness, shear slowness, Young's modulus (static and dynamic) and Poison's ratio. Variable clustering was used to remove collinearity, decrease variable redundancy, and choose the best variables for analysis. Cluster analysis was performed on the chosen variables to identify factors that differentiate data segments from the population. The data was randomly portioned into a 70:30 training and validation split and model competition amongst the suite of machine learning algorithms mentioned above was used to select the champion model based on the least ASE of the validation dataset. Results show that neural networks and random forests generated the best prediction of UCS and synthetic PE logs compared to other machine learning algorithms used.},

	abstract = {A methodology to generate synthetic wireline logs is presented. Synthetic logs can help analyze the reservoir properties in areas where the set of logs that are necessary, are absent or incomplete. The approach presented involves the use of Artificial Neural Networks as the main tool, in conjunction with data obtained from conventional wireline logs. Implementation of this approach aims to reduce costs to companies. Development of the neural network model was completed using Generalized Regression Neural Network, and wireline logs from four wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, and resistivity logs. Synthetic logs were generated through two different exercises. Exercise one involved all four wells for training, calibration and verification process. The second exercise used three wells for training and calibration and the fourth well was used for verification. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, three different combinations of inputs/outputs were chosen to train the network. In combination "A" the resistivity log was the output and density, gamma ray, and neutron logs, and the coordinates and depths (XYZ) the inputs. In combination "B" the density log was output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the neutron logs, and XYZ were the inputs, and in combination "C" the neutron log was the output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the density logs, and XYZ were the inputs. After development of the neural network model, synthetic logs with a reasonable degree of accuracy were generated. Results indicate that the best performance was obtained for combination "A" of inputs and outputs, then for combination "C", and finally for combination "B". In addition, it was determined that accuracy of synthetic logs is favored by interpolation of data. As an important conclusion, it was demonstrated that quality of the data plays a very important role in developing a neural network model. Copyright 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The estimation of lithology from multiple geophysical survey methods needs to be addressed to develop advanced tomographic methods. An initial requirement for lithology discrimination is that lithology should be discriminable from the media properties physically related to the geophysical observations. To test this condition for different combinations of the most common crustal rocks, we performed several lithology discrimination exercises on rock samples under laboratory conditions. The physical properties included mass density, compressional velocity, shear velocity, electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility. A categorical description of the sample lithology was followed; hence, the inference consisted of predicting the sample rock category (lithotype) membership. The joint information provided by the physical properties of the rocks allowed us to discriminate the sample lithotype correctly, with an overall success rate of 100{\%} in the most favorable situation and over 85{\%} in the least favorable situation. We obtained successful classification results for a variety of common lithotypes (granite, gabbro, limestone, tuff, marble, basalt, and gneiss) using three common classification methods: clustering analysis, Gaussian classification, and discriminant analysis. Although discrimination was positive with each of these multivariate classification techniques, discriminant analysis showed some advantages for the classification and graphic analysis of the data. These results support our postulate that lithology can be estimated reliably if multiple geophysical observations are considered jointly.},

We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples.

	abstract={AbstractHole problems during the drilling phase of operations are often the consequence of mechanical wellbore instability. This leads to higher than necessary drilling costs. A linear-elastic analysis is frequently proposed for the prediction of the onset of failure, and consequently the mud weights required to prevent hole instability. However, there is no clear choice of which compressive failure criterion to use in the analysis. This paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed failure criteria on mud weight selection. The failure criteria selected is shown to have an extremely significant effect on the computed 'safe' mud weights. Examples related to field situations are presented which highlight the anomalies and contrary evidence relating to the suitability of failure criteria. IntroductionThe increasing demand for wellbore stability analyses during the planning stage of a field arises from economic considerations and the escalating use of deviated, extended reach and horizontal wells. Wellbore instability can result in lost circulation (Figure la) where tensile failure has occurred, and spalling and/or hole closure (Figure lb) in the case of compressive failure. In severe cases the hole instability can lead to stuck pipe and eventually loss of the open hole section. The causes of instability are often classified into either chemical or mechanical effects. Often, field instances of instability are a result of a combination of both chemical and mechanical effects. However, only mechanical effects are considered here. Due to the large costs associated with wellbore instability this subject has received considerable attention in the literature over the past two decades ([l] to [161). The majority of the literature focuses on analytical aspects of wellbore stability. In a previous publication [151 the authors reviewed strength criteria used in many of the models published and showed that certain criteria do not stand up to close scrutiny when compared with laboratory strength test data. In this paper the effect of strength criteria on mud weight selection is highlighted to show some of the anomalies and contrary evidence which can make the choice of a strength criterion difficult and confusing when performing wellbore stability analyses. 2.0 BACKGROUND TO WELLBORE STABILITY MODELLING Before a well is drilled, compressive stresses exist within the rock formations (Figure 2). With the exception of structurally complex areas (e.g. near salt diapirs), the in-situ stresses can be resolved into a vertical or overburden stress, , and two horizontal stresses, (the maximum horizontal stress), and (the minimum horizontal stress), which are generally unequal. When the well is drilled, the rock stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore are redistributed as the support originally offered by the drilled out rock is replaced by the hydraulic pressure of the mud. pressure of the mud.

Potential exists to minimize borehole problems by planning wellbore trajectory and orientation, the directions of perforations, and by implementing leak-off tests. Wellbore instabilities, while drilling or during completion and operation, are the consequence of many phenomena and several factors. These include solid–fluid interaction (between rock materials and drilling fluid), challenging and complex stress conditions, wellbore deviation and multiplicity, irregular formation reservoir behavior, inconsistency or lack of appropriate drilling and operating practices, deep-water operation, and high-pressure high-temperature reservoirs. In this chapter, we will discuss the first three phenomena in detail with the key focus on the main borehole failure mechanisms, that is, fracturing and collapse. We will show how the methods and data of the previous chapters are used to analyze borehole instability problems.}

An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Results: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observations.},

Since 1999 the Navajo Education Technology Consortium's (NETC) TECHShare project, funded under the Star Schools program, has developed over 260 multimedia lessons to improve student learning. The primary target population for the study is located within or near the Navajo Nation, with the majority of the students performing well below the national average in academic achievement. To assess the effect that these TECHShare lessons have had on student achievement, the Model Classroom Study was conducted to gather rich qualitative information combined with pre to post test improvement results on selected web based multimedia lessons. The results of a paired t-test study found that, on average, there was a significant increase from the pre test (M= 57{\%}) to the posttest (M= 79{\%}) of about 22{\%}.},

We show how to accelerate it dramatically, while still always computing exactly the same result as the standard algorithm. The accelerated algorithm avoids unnecessary distance calculations by applying the triangle inequality in two different ways, and by keeping track of lower and upper bounds for distances between points and centers. Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases. For k ≥ 20 it is many times faster than the best previously known accelerated k-means method.},

In this paper, we propose a new acceleration for exact k-means that gives the same answer, but is much faster in practice. Like Elkan's accelerated algorithm [8], our algorithm avoids distance computations using distance bounds and the triangle inequality. Our algorithm uses one novel lower bound for point-center distances, which allows it to eliminate the innermost k-means loop 80{\%} of the time or more in our experiments. On datasets of low and medium dimension (e.g. up to 50 dimensions), our algorithm is much faster than other methods, including methods based on low-dimensional indexes, such as k-d trees. Other advantages are that it is very simple to implement and it has a very small memory overhead, much smaller than other accelerated algorithms.},

	abstract = {This paper is about metric data structures in high-dimensional or non-Euclidean space that permit cached sufficient statistics accelerations of learning algorithms. It has recently been shown that for less than about 10 dimensions, decorating kd-trees with additional "cached sufficient statistics" such as first and second moments and contingency tables can provide satisfying acceleration for a very wide range of statistical learning tasks such as kernel regression, locally weighted regression, k-means clustering, mixture modeling and Bayes Net learning. In this paper, we begin by defining the anchors hierarchy - a fast data structure and algorithm for localizing data based only on a triangle-inequality-obeying distance metric. We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data. But more importantly we show how it can produce a well-balanced structure similar to a Ball-Tree (Omohundro, 1991) or a kind of metric tree (Uhlmann, 1991; Ciaccia, Patella, {\&} Zezula, 1997) in a way that is neither "top-down" nor "bottom-up" but instead "middle-out". We then show how this structure, decorated with cached sufficient statistics, allows a wide variety of statistical learning algorithms to be accelerated even in thousands of dimensions.},

Three species of them are new: Echinocyamus belali, Antillaster farisi and Metalia lindaae. The Caribbean genus Antillaster which is recorded for the first time from the Mediterranean region, suggests an east – west migration from the Tethys and Paratethys to the Caribbean region during the Eocene time by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a westerly direction. The paleoecology and the paleogeography of the echinoid fauna are discussed. The paleoecological study appears to revel that the Middle Eocene rocks of that area were deposited in a shallow marine water conditions. Paleogeographically, 33.3{\%} of the total echinoids are endemic to Egypt, 66.7{\%} species are similar to that of the taxa of the adjacent countries.},

	abstract = {In oil reservoirs management one of the challenges is to predict the behaviour of the fluid flow. Identifying the flow units is complex task, therefore it is necessary to perform the characterization of rocks. Parameters such as porosity and permeability must be known. The use of statistics is useful to perform reservoir division into zones using core data and geophysical well logs. This research aims to apply two alternative well established techniques useful for the recognition of flow units in the Namorado field and conduct a comparative analysis of the techniques by looking at the results obtained in both approaches, as well as obtain the three-dimensional model of this field, as indicated by both techniques. The techniques used in this work are statistical zoning and flow zone index (FZI). In this research was used permeability data from 15 wells provided by the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency. In the first technique were calculated the variances between zones, grouped variances within zones and finally the zoning index with which it was possible divide the field into zones. On application of FZI the greatest value of the index indicated the depth of division between zones. After zones recognition, two model were constructed, the first one based on statistical zoning, indicating the zones; and the second based in FZI, pointing out the location of the zones corresponding to the reservoir and those associated with the non- reservoir. For the construction of three-dimensional models the geostatistical software SGeMS was used. According to the obtained results was evidenced that the techniques of statistical and FZI zoning have produced equivalent results in some wells, but different in others. However, the FZI method presented, in most wells, more satisfactory results compared to the statistical zoning. Keywords:},

	abstract = {A Bayesian linear inversion methodology based on Gaussian mixture models and its application to geophysical inverse problems are presented in this paper. The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary first-order Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30{\%} in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

It is known that these iterative techniques are especially sensitive to initial starting conditions. We present a procedure for computing a refined starting condition from a given initial one that is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. The refined initial starting condition allows the iterative algorithm to converge to a “better” local minimum. The procedure is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for both discrete and continuous data. We demonstrate the application of this method to the popular K-Means clustering algorithm and show that refined initial starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. Refinement run time is considerably lower than the time required to cluster the full database. The method is scalable and can be coupled with a scalable clustering algorithm to address the large-scale clustering problems in data mining.},

The wireline well logs used are sonic, gamma ray, neutron porosity, bulk density and resistivity. We solve this inverse problem in a predictive Bayesian setting, and perform the associated model parameter estimation. Spatial vertical structure of the facies is included in the model by a Markov chain assumption, making geological model interpretation possible. We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect. Results from a blind well indicate that facies predictions from our model are more reliable than predictions from the naive model in terms of correct facies classification and predicted layer thickness.},

In the studied area, located in the center-west of Campos Basin, was elaborated one stratigraphic analysis using logs and cores provided by twenty three wells. This work aims i) to determine the reservoir facies and non reservoir facies; ii) to understand vertical and lateral facies association by using well correlation; iii) to compose a stratigraphic framework; iv) to define the main limits of the Namorado Sandstone spatial distribution in the studied area; v) to evaluate the main direction of the sand supply, and vi) to identify the type of the reservoir according to Bruhn (1998) classification. Five stratigraphic cross sections were composed and allowed to the recognition of three depositional cycles for the Namorado Sandstones: bottom, intermidiate and top cycle. The mapped reservoir facies were interpreted as channel lobe complex in comparison with geometrical parameters description according to Bruhn {\&} Moraes (1988) model. Spatial analysis of net sand maps and simulated images suggest a NW-SE orientation for the depositional axis of turbiditic sandstones. According to the Bruhn (1998)'s classification for the Brazilian deep water reservoirs, the type that better represents the studied reservoir is the GSLc type – Confined, Gravel/Sand-Rich Lobes.},

	abstract = {Image retrieval based on color histograms requires quantization of a color space. Uniform scalar quantization of each color channel is a popular method for the reduction of histogram dimensionality. With this method, however, no spatial information among pixels is considered in constructing the histograms. Vector quantization (VQ) provides a simple and effective means for exploiting spatial information by clustering groups of pixels. We propose the use of Gauss mixture vector quantization (GMVQ) as a quantization method for color histogram generation. GMVQ is known to be robust for quantizer mismatch, which motivates its use in making color histograms for both the query image and the images in the database. Results show that the histograms made by GMVQ with a penalized log-likelihood (LL) distortion yield better retrieval performance for color images than the conventional methods of uniform quantization and VQ with squared error distortion.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large da- tabases.

In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis- cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an ap- propriate value for it. We performed an experimental evalua- tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench- mark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clus- ters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR- ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency},

Standard statistical methods like linear and quadratic discriminant or cluster analysis treat the individual measurement points of well logs as independent samples of the underlying distribution. With hidden Markov models (HMM) the knowledge of statistical dependency between successive data points in a well log can be incorporated in the classification process. The sequence of lithological classes is modelled as a discrete, finite, homogeneous, first order Markov chain of transitions between states. This state sequence can be unobserved or is generally hidden from the observer. The only necessary information about the hidden state sequence is an observed sequence of state-dependent outputs. This output information is used to estimate the hidden state sequence which most probably has caused the given output sequence. The performance of HMM is evaluated on simulated data and on a real data set from eight wells near Berlin (Germany) with final depths between 60 and 140 metres. The results are compared with the outcome of the quadratic discriminant analysis.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Malartic deposit is a world class intrusion-related Archean gold deposit hosted in the Pontiac Subprovince, Superior Province, in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Laboratory petrophysical properties measurements were performed on 824 rock samples collected from the various rock types observed within the ore body and peripheral host rocks. The various rock types present in the Malartic District, mainly meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have contrasting grain densities and magnetic susceptibilities. Using support vector machines, it is shown that these two physical properties can be used to predict the rock type of a sample with an average precision and recall rate of 89{\%}. Within the meta-sedimentary rocks class, variations in magnetic susceptibility are due to the changes in mineralogy associated with hydrothermal alteration. These are caused by the destruction of iron-bearing silicate minerals and magnetite in unaltered rocks (10−4 to 10−3 SI) to form pyrite, carbonates, K-feldspar and Fe-depleted hydrothermal biotite in altered rocks (10−5 to 10−4 SI). Within the felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks, grain densities below 2.7 g/cm3 and magnetic susceptibilities in the 10−6 to 10−4 SI range yield the highest probabilities that a rock has been submitted to carbonate and pyrite alteration. However, magnetic susceptibility and grain density of these intrusive rocks are also dependent on their Fe2O3/Al2O3 and TiO2/Al2O3 ratios, which are not related to the hydrothermal alteration footprint, but are rather due to distinct protolith compositions. Within the mafic dykes, grain density is the best indicator of hydrothermal alteration. Unaltered mafic dykes (2.95 to 3.10 g/cm3) are mostly composed of amphibole, whereas altered mafic dykes (2.70 to 2.95 g/cm3) have reduced amphibole contents and higher abundances of carbonates, pyrite, quartz, and biotite alteration. The support vector machine classifier is extended to predict if meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have undergone hydrothermal alteration with average F1 scores of 73{\%}, 69{\%} and 93{\%}, respectively. In altered meta-sedimentary rocks, the integration of grain density and magnetic susceptibility allows the identification of altered but unmineralized samples. The classifier is further extended to predict if the gold content of meta-sedimentary rocks is above or below threshold values of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 ppm with average F1 scores of 83{\%}, 80{\%}, and 76{\%}, respectively. Using conceptual models of the rock physical properties at the Malartic District scale, it is shown that ground magnetic surveys are the most promising geophysical tool for early-stage greenfield exploration of this type of deposit. However, depending on the scale at which the surveys are conducted, magnetic susceptibility contrasts between the various investigated rock types can overshadow the specific signatures of hydrothermally altered rocks. This in part explains why past airborne geophysical exploration campaigns for this type of deposit in the Malartic District were inconclusive. Finally, the machine learning process used in this case study can be applied in advanced exploration stages, during which drilling and either subsequent laboratory petrophysical analyses of core samples or downhole geophysical surveys produce large amounts of data that can be used to train prediction models.},

	abstract = {Coal is an unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir which is both the source and reservoir for the formed methane. Extraction of methane involves altering the existing conditions and these changes can lead to damage of the reservoir. For sustained production of coalbed methane (CBM), damage of coal needs to be minimized. Formation damage refers to the changes in the producing formation that leads to decline in coal permeability which eventually leads to the decline in production. This chapter discusses the various mechanisms in the reservoir that lead to formation damage. It describes and discusses the major types of formation damage that commonly occur when drilling CBM reservoirs. The emphasis is on the most common types of formation damage, that are those associated with drilling, completion, and specifically hydraulic fracturing. Further, damage due to volumetric deformation of coal matrix and production-related reservoir failure are also discussed.}

	abstract = {Because of the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

@article{He2016,
	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

	abstract = {Part I attempts to review the background, basic sources of data, concepts, and methodology to be employed in the study of perceptrons. In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

	abstract = {Equivalent staggered grid scheme (ESG) is a new family of schemes based on the finite-difference method (FDM). The method is applied to acoustic wave propagation in variable density media and the results are compared with those from some classic FDM approaches. The main feature of this new family is that it is designed to generate results numerically equivalent to those using the standard staggered grid formulations (SSG), but with the same memory requirements of simple grid schemes. Hence, it results in a reduction of memory usage by 33{\%} in 2D and 50{\%} in 3D problems, compared to the memory usage of SSG. The first-order system of equations in terms of pressure and velocity is not used here. Instead, the formulation is based on applying new central difference operators to the second-order acoustic wave equation in terms of pressure, obtaining the same level of accuracy and stability as the SSG schemes. The equivalence between the ESG and SSG is mathematically demonstrated and issues concerning the application of seismic sources and the boundary conditions are addressed.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90{\%} accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.},

	abstract = {The set of geological elements that control the petroleum existence and distribution in the sedimentary basins are integrated under the concept of petroleum systems. Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

Here we describe a study of the applicability of neural networks to solving some geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we study the problem of obtaining formation resistivities and layer thicknesses from vertical electrical sounding (VES) data and that of obtaining 1D velocity models from seismic waveform data. We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as approximately 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404+/-8 Myr--about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O values from 7.4 to 5.0{\%}), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high delta18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a delta18O value from 8.5 to 9.5{\%}. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As geophysicists, we are trained to conceptualize geophysical problems in detail. However, machine learning algorithms are more difficult to understand and are often thought of as simply “black boxes.” A numerical example is used here to illustrate the difference between geophysical inversion and inversion by machine learning. In doing so, an attempt is made to demystify machine learning algorithms and show that, like inverse problems, they have a definite mathematical structure that can be written down and understood. The example used is the extraction of the underlying reflection coefficients from a synthetic seismic response that was created by convolving a reflection coefficient dipole with a symmetric wavelet. Because the dipole is below the seismic tuning frequency, the overlapping wavelets create both an amplitude increase and extra nonphysical reflection coefficients in the synthetic seismic data. This is a common problem in real seismic data. In discussing the solution to this problem, the topics of deconvolution, recursive inversion, linear regression, and nonlinear regression using a feedforward neural network are covered. It is shown that if the inputs to the deconvolution problem are fully understood, this is the optimal way to extract the true reflection coefficients. However, if the geophysics is not fully understood and large amounts of data are available, machine learning can provide a viable alternative to geophysical inversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that the accurate identification of carbonate rock types in a reservoir can be employed as a preliminary step to enhance the effectiveness of petrophysical property modeling. Furthermore, rock typing activity has been shown to be of key importance in several steps of formation evaluation, such as the study of sedimentary series, reservoir zonation and well-to-well correlation. In this paper, a methodology based exclusively on the analysis of 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation responses – using data mining algorithms – is evaluated to perform the automatic classification of carbonate samples according to their rock type. We analyze the effectiveness of six different classification algorithms (k-NN, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, C4.5, Random Forest, SMO and Multilayer Perceptron) and two data preprocessing strategies (discretization and feature selection). The dataset used in this evaluation is formed by 78 1H-NMR T2 distributions of fully brine-saturated rock samples from six different rock type classes. The experiments reveal that the combination of preprocessing strategies with classification algorithms is able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 97.4{\%}.},

The main problems arising in the process of the factor space division into the test, validation and training sets were formulated. An approach based on the use of clustering that allowed to increase the entropy of the training set was put forward. Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) were examined as an effective clustering procedure. Based on such maps, the clustering of factor spaces of different dimensions was carried out, and a representative sample was formed. To verify our approach we synthesized the MLP neural network and trained it. The training technique was performed with the sets formed both with and without clustering. The approach under consideration was concluded to have an influence on the increase in the entropy of the training set and (as a result) to lead to the quality improvement of MLP training with the small dimension of the factor space.},

	abstract = {Field characterization in oil industry is a challenging task which aims to determine or estimate some of the petrophysical properties of a reservoir. These properties are expected to be later used in a non-deterministic workflow (which might depend on subjective interpretations carried out by each petrophysicist) whose aim is to answer questions such as whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. Three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. Obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. Hence, it is common to use other tools (such as wirelogging tools or borehole imagers) to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at which no core sample could be extracted. In this context, estimating lithofacies helps petrophysicists to automatize the process of identifying the lithology of the reservoir. Previous work (Basu et al., 2002; Chai et al., 2009; Linek et al., 2007; Newberry et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1996) used a considerable amount of wirelog data and borehole image logs to induce the lithology of the reservoir. In the work presented in this paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatic reservoir lithofacies identification. Our model relies only on ultrasonic and microresistivity borehole image logs as inputs, which are characterized by a deep residual convolutional network which then infers the probability of each sample to be classified as each type of previously defined lithofacies classes. The method presented in this work was tested on a carbonate well from the Brazilian pre-salt oilfields, and it allowed us to obtain an average classification accuracy of 81.45{\%} and an average area under the ROC curve of 92.70{\%} for all classes, for the blind test sample.},

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.},

However, such information is often limited for most groundwater basins. This study explores the usefulness and potential of a hybrid soft-computing framework; a traditional artificial neural network with gradient descent-momentum training (ANN-GDM) and a traditional genetic algorithm (GA) based ANN (ANN-GA) approach were developed and compared with a novel hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) based ANN (SOM-ANN-GA) method for the prediction of lithology at a basin scale. This framework is demonstrated through a case study involving a complex multi-layered aquifer system in India, where well-log sites were clustered on the basis of sand-layer frequencies; within each cluster, subsurface layers were reclassified into four depth classes based on the maximum drilling depth. ANN models for each depth class were developed using each of the three approaches. Of the three, the hybrid SOM-ANN-GA models were able to recognize incomplete geologic pattern more reasonably, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-GDM models. It is concluded that the hybrid soft-computing framework can serve as a promising tool for characterizing lithology in groundwater basins with missing lithologic patterns.},

	abstract = {Pattern recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a black box that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (x, y, and z) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a SOM model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decomposition algorithm to capture the sedimentary cycle pattern as an attribute. If we correlate this attribute to the training data, it will favor SOM facies maps that follow stratigraphy. We apply this workflow to a Barnett Shale data set and find that the constrained SOM facies map shows layers that are easily overlooked on traditional unconstrained SOM facies map.},

It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin.

Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

	abstract = {The Guara and Botucatu formations comprise an 80 to 120 m thick continental succession that crops out on the western portion of the Rio Grande do Sul State (Southernmost Brazil). The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating reservoir parameters from geophysical data is vitally important in hydrocarbon exploration and production. We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

In the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, heart of industrialized Brazil, hydroelectric power derived from waterfalls developed on the Cretaceous basaltic cover, gemstones and rich soils both derived again from the basalts, and ground- water from Jurassic eolian sandstones are the main resources. Bituminous shales, and more recently, gas discoveries constitute secondary resources; gas seems to characterize the Argentinian Chaco-Paran{\'{a}} Basin. In the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin, the development of significant reserves of gas, and less noticeably of oil, is hampered by the remoteness of the area and lack of a nearby mar- ket. For the same reasons, in the Amazonas Basin large reserves of evaporites lie untouched in the subsurface; recent gas discoveries made near the capital jungle of Manaus point to a brighter future for their exploitation. In the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin, situated in a remote semi-arid region of Brazil, groundwater is the main exploited min- eral resource. Considering their geological characteristics, the small amount of exploration performed in these basins is in sharp contrast with their petroleum potential.

One of us calculated 200 m ?? 50 m and 50 m ?? 50 m loop responses of a uniform polarizable conductor with varied Cole-Cole parameters and imposed synthetic Gaussian noise that simulated measurement errors. Then the generated pseudo-experimental data passed to the other co-author who performed single and joint 1D inversion twice: first being unaware of the "true" underlying models and then after being told that they all were represented by a uniform polarizable earth. More than a half of the fitted models provided a good idea of the true models though misfit was quite large in some cases. The fit was better in single inversion with a priori information available, and improved further through joint inversion of central-loop and coincident-loop responses. Joint inversion with a priori information known was of good quality even at a chargeability as low as 0.02. The standard error in joint inversion was times the measurement error and depended mainly on fitting errors for smaller-loop data. The reason is that the smaller-loop transients included a non-monotonous interval where the signal changed rapidly under the effect of fast-decaying induced polarization. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Breakup of the North Atlantic during the early tertiary was accompanied by widespread and massive magmatism, resulting in the coverage of large areas of the North Atlantic with flood basalts. These flood basalts hamper seismic investigations of underlying sequences and thus the understanding of the rifting, subsidence and evolution of the margin which, in turn, increases the risk for hydrocarbon exploration. In this paper we present a methodology for the simultaneous joint inversion of diverse geophysical datasets, i.e. free air gravity and magnetotelluric soundings (MT) using seismic a priori constraints. The attraction of the joint inversion approach is that different geophysical measurements are sensitive to different properties of the sub-surface, so through joint inversion we significantly reduce the null space and produce a single model that fits all datasets within a predefined tolerance. Using sensitivity analysis of synthetic data, we show how each data set contains complementary important information of the supra and sub-basalt structure. While separate inversions of individual datasets fail to image through the basalt layer, our joint inversion approach leads to a much improved sub-basalt structure. Application of the joint inversion algorithm to satellite gravity data and MT data acquired on the FLARE10 seismic line south west of Faroe islands supports the existence of a 1??km to 2??km thick low velocity region that might be indicative of the existence of a sedimentary basin underneath the basalt layer. Though in this paper we demonstrate the use of joint inversion on a sub-basalt target, we believe it has wider applicability to other areas where conventional seismic imaging fails. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD.

In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing.

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the resulting models may suffer from insufficient resolution, which leads to underestimated variability and poor mass recovery. Structural joint inversion using cross-gradient constraints can provide higher-resolution models compared with individual inversions and we present the first application to time-lapse data. The results from a synthetic and field vadose zone water tracer injection experiment show that joint 3-D time-lapse inversion of crosshole electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) traveltime data significantly improve the imaged characteristics of the point injected plume, such as lateral spreading and center of mass, as well as the overall consistency between models. The joint inversion method appears to work well for cases when one hydrological state variable (in this case moisture content) controls the time-lapse response of both geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most learning algorithms, including ANN, are designed for well-balanced data and do not work properly on imbalanced ones. Of the approaches proposed for dealing with this problem, we are interested in the re-sampling ones, since they are algorithm-independent. We have recently proposed a new under-sampling technique for the two-class problem, called Non-Target Incremental Learning (NTIL), which has shown a good performance with SVM, improving results and training speed. Here, the advantages of using this technique with ANN are shown. The performance with regard to other popular under-sampling techniques is compared.},

	abstract = {An extensive study of the resistivity structure of the Hengill area in SW Iceland was carried out by the combined use of TEM and MT soundings. Joint inversion of the collected data can correct for static shifts in the MT data, which can be severe due to large near-surface resistivity contrasts. Joint 1D inversion of 148 TEM/MT sounding pairs and a 3D inversion of a 60 sounding subset of the MT data were performed. The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100-240 ??C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3-10 km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The pseudo-Ep was then calculated using the estimated contribution coefficients. The range of pseudo-Ep was adjusted for conversion to the Ep of cavities, and this new approach was verified by comparison with previous researches and commensurate with previous results.

We specifically discuss, in detail, neuromorphic designs including spiking neural network hardware, cellular neural network implementations, reconfigurable FPGA based implementations, in particular, for stochastic ANN models, and optical implementations. Parallel digital implementations employing bit-slice, systolic, and SIMD architectures, implementations for associative neural memories, and RAM based implementations are also outlined.

	abstract = {Seismic methods continue to receive interest for use in mineral exploration due to the much higher resolution potential of seismic data compared to the techniques traditionally used, namely, gravity, magnetics, resistivity, and electromagnetics. However, the complicated geology often encountered in hard-rock exploration can make data processing and interpretation difficult. Inverting seismic data jointly with a complementary data set can help overcome these difficulties and facilitate the construction of a common earth model. We considered the joint inversion of seismic first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data to recover causative slowness and density distributions. Our joint inversion algorithm differs from previous work by (1) incorporating a large suite of measures for coupling the two physical property models, (2) slowly increasing the effect of the coupling to help avoid potential convergence issues, and (3) automatically adjusting two Tikhonov tradeoff parameters to achieve a desired fit to both data sets. The coupling measures used are both compositional and structural in nature and allow the inclusion of explicitly known or implicitly assumed empirical relationships, physical property distribution information, and cross-gradient structural coupling. For any particular exploration scenario, the combination of coupling measures used should be guided by the geologic knowledge available. We performed our inversions on unstructured grids comprised of triangular cells in 2D, or tetrahedral cells in 3D, but the joint inversion methods are equally applicable to rectilinear grids. We tested our joint inversion methodology on scenarios based on the Voisey's Bay massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada. These scenarios present a challenge to the inversion of first-arrival traveltimes and we show how joint inversion with gravity data can improve recovery of the subsurface features.},

The main exploration targets are the top of the fractured Precambrian crystalline basement and any concealed basement grabens, the overlying presalt and salt/carbonate deposits, and the postsalt cover deposits. The results of joint inversion clearly mapped the various units and are a significant improvement over previous models derived from separate 2D seismic reflection processing and 2D magnetotelluric imaging. Additionally, multispectral fusion of these models resulted in a single image that permits highly constrained geologic interpretations enabling a better understanding of basin architecture. We suggest that joint inversion and image fusion is the way forward for effective geophysical integration.},

More importantly, we examine the reliability of velocity-conductivity relationships derived from structure-coupled joint inversion approaches. Comparison with a seismic reflection section shows that our models match the upper limit of the salt. Furthermore, velocity and resistivity logs from a borehole drilled into the salt dome's flank match, within error, those recovered by the inversion. The good match suggests that the difference in length scale does not have a significant effect in this case. This provides a strong incentive to incorporate borehole data into the joint inversion in the future and substantiates approaches that use the relationships derived from joint inversion models for lithological classification.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

	abstract = {The fracture porosity is estimated especially through the log data (density, neutron porosity and transit time) and the characteristics of the mud (fluid density, transit time of the saturating fluid). If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

Most of the regression models generally used sunshine hour data for the estimation of global solar radiations on the horizontal surfaces, whereas maximum artificial neural network models have used multilayer feed forward network sigmoid trained with Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation algorithm with different input terminals and different hidden layer neurons. Artificial neural networks have been successfully employed in solving complex problems in various fields such as function approximation, pattern association and pattern recognition, associative memories and generation of new meaningful pattern. Comparison of regression and artificial neural network models have shown that the performance values of the artificial neural network models are better than the regression models. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) values of the artificial neural network models are lower than those of the regression models. In addition, the R values of the artificial neural network models are higher than those of regression models.

	abstract = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are a powerful mechanism for pattern recognition. Aiming at enhancing their learning capabilities, Multi-valued Probabilistic Logic Nodes (M-PLN) are used, instead of crisp neurons with a 0/1 based RAM-nodes. An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85{\%} based on digital airborne videography. Rond{\^{o}}nia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rond{\^{o}}nia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2{\%}, increasing to 3{\%} by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18{\%} and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rond{\^{o}}nia (Ji-Paran{\'{a}}), deforestation rates rose from 1.2{\%} between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2{\%} in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5{\%} but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3{\%} in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paran{\'{a}} and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

This work is a survey of the specific application of data mining in learning management systems and a case study tutorial with the Moodle system. Our objective is to introduce it both theoretically and practically to all users interested in this new research area, and in particular to online instructors and e-learning administrators. We describe the full process for mining e-learning data step by step as well as how to apply the main data mining techniques used, such as statistics, visualization, classification, clustering and association rule mining of Moodle data. We have used free data mining tools so that any user can immediately begin to apply data mining without having to purchase a commercial tool or program a specific personalized tool. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These measurements are generated continuously and in a very high fluctuating data rates. Examples include sensor networks, web logs, and computer network traffic. The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. Algorithms, systems and frameworks that address streaming challenges have been developed over the past three years. In this review paper, we present the state-of-the-art in this growing vital field.},

Previous studies show that sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear significantly influence the formation and frequent changes of tropical cyclones. This paper presents the utilization of a new approach, data mining, to discover the collective contributions to tropical cyclones from sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear, and zonal stretching deformation. A decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm was generated to illustrate the influence of geophysical parameters on the formation of tropical cyclone in weighted correlations. From the decision tree, we also induced decision rules to reveal the quantitative regularities and co-effects of [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear], [atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear], [sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], and other combinations to tropical cyclone formation. The research improved previous findings in (1) preparing more precise criteria for future tropical cyclone prediction, and (2) applying data mining algorithms in studying tropical cyclones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

	abstract = {Large magnitude earthquakes in urban environments continue to kill and injure tens to hundreds of thousands of people, inflicting lasting societal and economic disasters. Earthquake early warning (EEW) provides seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people to move to safe zones and automated slowdown and shutdown of transit and other machinery. The handful of EEW systems operating around the world use traditional seismic and geodetic networks that exist only in a few nations. Smartphones are much more prevalent than traditional networks and contain accelerometers that can also be used to detect earthquakes. We report on the development of a new type of seismic system, MyShake, that harnesses personal/private smartphone sensors to collect data and analyze earthquakes. We show that smartphones can record magnitude 5 earthquakes at distances of 10 km or less and develop an on-phone detection capability to separate earthquakes from other everyday shakes. Our proof-of-concept system then collects earthquake data at a central site where a network detection algorithm confirms that an earthquake is under way and estimates the location and magnitude in real time. This information can then be used to issue an alert of forthcoming ground shaking. MyShake could be used to enhance EEW in regions with traditional networks and could provide the only EEW capability in regions without. In addition, the seismic waveforms recorded could be used to deliver rapid microseism maps, study impacts on buildings, and possibly image shallow earth structure and earthquake rupture kinematics.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

Using synthetic data is challenging due to the differences in feature distributions between synthetic and real data, a phenomenon we term synthetic gap. In this paper, we investigate and formalize a general framework - Stacked Multichannel Autoencoder (SMCAE) that enables bridging the synthetic gap and learning from synthetic data more efficiently. In particular, we show that our SMCAE can not only transform and use synthetic data on the challenging face-sketch recognition task, but that it can also help simulate real images, which can be used for training classifiers for recognition.

	abstract = {When using wireline log to characterize formation properties for an area we often run into incomplete datasets. One way to address this lack of data is to create synthetic curves to use in the analysis. This paper will cover workflows to generate synthetic photoelectric (PE) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) logs. Modern well log data sets usually include PE logs which provides important information about the lithology of the formations the wellbore intersects. However, many legacy wells do not have PE logs that we need in order to understand the lithology of these formations. Similarly, it is important to obtain UCS data from mechanical failure tests done to core samples to determine the strength of the rock. Obtaining and testing core samples for the entire zones of interest is both expensive and time consuming. Synthetic well logs can be a reliable and cheaper alternative to predicting PE and UCS values rather than running a new set of logs or coring and testing the whole zone of interest. In the first workflow, Synthetic PE logs were generated using wireline logs from over a hundred wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, resistivity logs and volume of clay. The data was randomly partitioned into a 70:30 split for training and validation data set respectively. Model competition among a suite of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest was used to select the best algorithm based on the least average squared error (ASE) of the validation dataset. In the second workflow, UCS data was generated using wireline logs and core rebound hammer data from fourteen wells including gamma ray, density, porosity, neutron, clay volume, kerogen volume, compressional slowness, shear slowness, Young's modulus (static and dynamic) and Poison's ratio. Variable clustering was used to remove collinearity, decrease variable redundancy, and choose the best variables for analysis. Cluster analysis was performed on the chosen variables to identify factors that differentiate data segments from the population. The data was randomly portioned into a 70:30 training and validation split and model competition amongst the suite of machine learning algorithms mentioned above was used to select the champion model based on the least ASE of the validation dataset. Results show that neural networks and random forests generated the best prediction of UCS and synthetic PE logs compared to other machine learning algorithms used.},

	abstract = {The estimation of lithology from multiple geophysical survey methods needs to be addressed to develop advanced tomographic methods. An initial requirement for lithology discrimination is that lithology should be discriminable from the media properties physically related to the geophysical observations. To test this condition for different combinations of the most common crustal rocks, we performed several lithology discrimination exercises on rock samples under laboratory conditions. The physical properties included mass density, compressional velocity, shear velocity, electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility. A categorical description of the sample lithology was followed; hence, the inference consisted of predicting the sample rock category (lithotype) membership. The joint information provided by the physical properties of the rocks allowed us to discriminate the sample lithotype correctly, with an overall success rate of 100{\%} in the most favorable situation and over 85{\%} in the least favorable situation. We obtained successful classification results for a variety of common lithotypes (granite, gabbro, limestone, tuff, marble, basalt, and gneiss) using three common classification methods: clustering analysis, Gaussian classification, and discriminant analysis. Although discrimination was positive with each of these multivariate classification techniques, discriminant analysis showed some advantages for the classification and graphic analysis of the data. These results support our postulate that lithology can be estimated reliably if multiple geophysical observations are considered jointly.},

We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect.

	abstract={AbstractHole problems during the drilling phase of operations are often the consequence of mechanical wellbore instability. This leads to higher than necessary drilling costs. A linear-elastic analysis is frequently proposed for the prediction of the onset of failure, and consequently the mud weights required to prevent hole instability. However, there is no clear choice of which compressive failure criterion to use in the analysis. This paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed failure criteria on mud weight selection. The failure criteria selected is shown to have an extremely significant effect on the computed 'safe' mud weights. Examples related to field situations are presented which highlight the anomalies and contrary evidence relating to the suitability of failure criteria. IntroductionThe increasing demand for wellbore stability analyses during the planning stage of a field arises from economic considerations and the escalating use of deviated, extended reach and horizontal wells. Wellbore instability can result in lost circulation (Figure la) where tensile failure has occurred, and spalling and/or hole closure (Figure lb) in the case of compressive failure. In severe cases the hole instability can lead to stuck pipe and eventually loss of the open hole section. The causes of instability are often classified into either chemical or mechanical effects. Often, field instances of instability are a result of a combination of both chemical and mechanical effects. However, only mechanical effects are considered here. Due to the large costs associated with wellbore instability this subject has received considerable attention in the literature over the past two decades ([l] to [161). The majority of the literature focuses on analytical aspects of wellbore stability. In a previous publication [151 the authors reviewed strength criteria used in many of the models published and showed that certain criteria do not stand up to close scrutiny when compared with laboratory strength test data. In this paper the effect of strength criteria on mud weight selection is highlighted to show some of the anomalies and contrary evidence which can make the choice of a strength criterion difficult and confusing when performing wellbore stability analyses. 2.0 BACKGROUND TO WELLBORE STABILITY MODELLING Before a well is drilled, compressive stresses exist within the rock formations (Figure 2). With the exception of structurally complex areas (e.g. near salt diapirs), the in-situ stresses can be resolved into a vertical or overburden stress, , and two horizontal stresses, (the maximum horizontal stress), and (the minimum horizontal stress), which are generally unequal. When the well is drilled, the rock stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore are redistributed as the support originally offered by the drilled out rock is replaced by the hydraulic pressure of the mud. pressure of the mud.

	abstract = {The principal in situ stresses are used to analyze the borehole problems such as fracturing, lost circulation, collapse, and sand production. Potential exists to minimize borehole problems by planning wellbore trajectory and orientation, the directions of perforations, and by implementing leak-off tests. Wellbore instabilities, while drilling or during completion and operation, are the consequence of many phenomena and several factors. These include solid–fluid interaction (between rock materials and drilling fluid), challenging and complex stress conditions, wellbore deviation and multiplicity, irregular formation reservoir behavior, inconsistency or lack of appropriate drilling and operating practices, deep-water operation, and high-pressure high-temperature reservoirs. In this chapter, we will discuss the first three phenomena in detail with the key focus on the main borehole failure mechanisms, that is, fracturing and collapse. We will show how the methods and data of the previous chapters are used to analyze borehole instability problems.}

To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, we propose a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle not only points objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The microarray technology is increasingly being applied in biological and medical research to address a wide range of problems such as the classification of tumors. An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Results: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observations.},

The primary target population for the study is located within or near the Navajo Nation, with the majority of the students performing well below the national average in academic achievement. To assess the effect that these TECHShare lessons have had on student achievement, the Model Classroom Study was conducted to gather rich qualitative information combined with pre to post test improvement results on selected web based multimedia lessons.

Our algorithm uses one novel lower bound for point-center distances, which allows it to eliminate the innermost k-means loop 80{\%} of the time or more in our experiments. On datasets of low and medium dimension (e.g. up to 50 dimensions), our algorithm is much faster than other methods, including methods based on low-dimensional indexes, such as k-d trees.

It has recently been shown that for less than about 10 dimensions, decorating kd-trees with additional "cached sufficient statistics" such as first and second moments and contingency tables can provide satisfying acceleration for a very wide range of statistical learning tasks such as kernel regression, locally weighted regression, k-means clustering, mixture modeling and Bayes Net learning. In this paper, we begin by defining the anchors hierarchy - a fast data structure and algorithm for localizing data based only on a triangle-inequality-obeying distance metric. We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data. But more importantly we show how it can produce a well-balanced structure similar to a Ball-Tree (Omohundro, 1991) or a kind of metric tree (Uhlmann, 1991; Ciaccia, Patella, {\&} Zezula, 1997) in a way that is neither "top-down" nor "bottom-up" but instead "middle-out". We then show how this structure, decorated with cached sufficient statistics, allows a wide variety of statistical learning algorithms to be accelerated even in thousands of dimensions.},

	abstract = {In oil reservoirs management one of the challenges is to predict the behaviour of the fluid flow. Identifying the flow units is complex task, therefore it is necessary to perform the characterization of rocks. Parameters such as porosity and permeability must be known. The use of statistics is useful to perform reservoir division into zones using core data and geophysical well logs. This research aims to apply two alternative well established techniques useful for the recognition of flow units in the Namorado field and conduct a comparative analysis of the techniques by looking at the results obtained in both approaches, as well as obtain the three-dimensional model of this field, as indicated by both techniques. The techniques used in this work are statistical zoning and flow zone index (FZI). In this research was used permeability data from 15 wells provided by the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency. In the first technique were calculated the variances between zones, grouped variances within zones and finally the zoning index with which it was possible divide the field into zones. On application of FZI the greatest value of the index indicated the depth of division between zones. After zones recognition, two model were constructed, the first one based on statistical zoning, indicating the zones; and the second based in FZI, pointing out the location of the zones corresponding to the reservoir and those associated with the non- reservoir. For the construction of three-dimensional models the geostatistical software SGeMS was used. According to the obtained results was evidenced that the techniques of statistical and FZI zoning have produced equivalent results in some wells, but different in others. However, the FZI method presented, in most wells, more satisfactory results compared to the statistical zoning. Keywords:},

	abstract = {A Bayesian linear inversion methodology based on Gaussian mixture models and its application to geophysical inverse problems are presented in this paper. The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary first-order Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30{\%} in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

	abstract = {Practical approaches to clustering use an iterative procedure (e.g. K-Means, EM) which converges to one of numerous local minima. It is known that these iterative techniques are especially sensitive to initial starting conditions. We present a procedure for computing a refined starting condition from a given initial one that is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. The refined initial starting condition allows the iterative algorithm to converge to a “better” local minimum. The procedure is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for both discrete and continuous data. We demonstrate the application of this method to the popular K-Means clustering algorithm and show that refined initial starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. Refinement run time is considerably lower than the time required to cluster the full database. The method is scalable and can be coupled with a scalable clustering algorithm to address the large-scale clustering problems in data mining.},

The wireline well logs used are sonic, gamma ray, neutron porosity, bulk density and resistivity. We solve this inverse problem in a predictive Bayesian setting, and perform the associated model parameter estimation. Spatial vertical structure of the facies is included in the model by a Markov chain assumption, making geological model interpretation possible. We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect. Results from a blind well indicate that facies predictions from our model are more reliable than predictions from the naive model in terms of correct facies classification and predicted layer thickness.},

However, the algorithm becomes unstable when detecting border objects of adjacent clusters as was mentioned in the article that introduced the algorithm. The final clustering result obtained from DBSCAN depends on the order in which objects are processed in the course of the algorithm run. In this article, a modified version of the DBSCAN algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. It was shown that by using the revised algorithm the clustering results are considerably improved, in particular for data sets containing dense structures with connected clusters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In the studied area, located in the center-west of Campos Basin, was elaborated one stratigraphic analysis using logs and cores provided by twenty three wells. This work aims i) to determine the reservoir facies and non reservoir facies; ii) to understand vertical and lateral facies association by using well correlation; iii) to compose a stratigraphic framework; iv) to define the main limits of the Namorado Sandstone spatial distribution in the studied area; v) to evaluate the main direction of the sand supply, and vi) to identify the type of the reservoir according to Bruhn (1998) classification. Five stratigraphic cross sections were composed and allowed to the recognition of three depositional cycles for the Namorado Sandstones: bottom, intermidiate and top cycle. The mapped reservoir facies were interpreted as channel lobe complex in comparison with geometrical parameters description according to Bruhn {\&} Moraes (1988) model. Spatial analysis of net sand maps and simulated images suggest a NW-SE orientation for the depositional axis of turbiditic sandstones. According to the Bruhn (1998)'s classification for the Brazilian deep water reservoirs, the type that better represents the studied reservoir is the GSLc type – Confined, Gravel/Sand-Rich Lobes.},

Uniform scalar quantization of each color channel is a popular method for the reduction of histogram dimensionality. With this method, however, no spatial information among pixels is considered in constructing the histograms. Vector quantization (VQ) provides a simple and effective means for exploiting spatial information by clustering groups of pixels. We propose the use of Gauss mixture vector quantization (GMVQ) as a quantization method for color histogram generation. GMVQ is known to be robust for quantizer mismatch, which motivates its use in making color histograms for both the query image and the images in the database. Results show that the histograms made by GMVQ with a penalized log-likelihood (LL) distortion yield better retrieval performance for color images than the conventional methods of uniform quantization and VQ with squared error distortion.},

We performed an experimental evalua- tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench- mark.

	abstract = {To the characterization of hidrocarbon reservoir is strategically important both detection and mapping of it heterogeneity, as it can establish a relationship between porosity and permeability, defining both productivity and commercial character of a field of oil and gas. The sedimentary petrofacies are a set of characteristics that individualize a particular group of rocks, and their determination allows the inference of the heterogeneity of the reservoir's heterogeneity. But this process is usually very long and not all information is harnessed, due to the large amount of data. Consequently, it becomes interesting change of use of manual methods for automatic analysis using computational tools. This work aims to present a computational method able to identify and separate them according to their common features. Thus, the method is able to assist the geologist/petrologist the task of identifying sedimentary petrofacies. Keywords:},

Gaussian expectation-maximization, and two new variants of k-harmonic means. Our aim is to find which aspects of these algorithms contribute to finding good clusterings, as opposed to converging to a low-quality local optimum. We describe each algorithm in a unified framework that introduces separate cluster membership and data weight functions. We then show that the algorithms do behave very differently from each other on simple low-dimensional synthetic datasets and image segmentation tasks, and that the A-harmonic means method is superior. Having a soft membership function is essential for finding high-quality clusterings, but having a non-constant data weight function is useful also.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the usefulness of hidden Markov models for lithological classification of geophysical measurements in boreholes. Standard statistical methods like linear and quadratic discriminant or cluster analysis treat the individual measurement points of well logs as independent samples of the underlying distribution. With hidden Markov models (HMM) the knowledge of statistical dependency between successive data points in a well log can be incorporated in the classification process. The sequence of lithological classes is modelled as a discrete, finite, homogeneous, first order Markov chain of transitions between states. This state sequence can be unobserved or is generally hidden from the observer. The only necessary information about the hidden state sequence is an observed sequence of state-dependent outputs. This output information is used to estimate the hidden state sequence which most probably has caused the given output sequence. The performance of HMM is evaluated on simulated data and on a real data set from eight wells near Berlin (Germany) with final depths between 60 and 140 metres. The results are compared with the outcome of the quadratic discriminant analysis.},

A new crossover operator that exploits a measure of similarity between chromosomes in a population is also presented. Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation are employed to prevent the convergence of the GAGR to a local optimum. Using the real-world data sets, we compare the performance of our GAGR clustering algorithm with K-means algorithm and other GA methods. An application of the GAGR clustering algorithm in unsupervised classification of multispectral remote sensing images is also provided.

@article{berube2018,
	abstract = {The Canadian Malartic deposit is a world class intrusion-related Archean gold deposit hosted in the Pontiac Subprovince, Superior Province, in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Laboratory petrophysical properties measurements were performed on 824 rock samples collected from the various rock types observed within the ore body and peripheral host rocks. The various rock types present in the Malartic District, mainly meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have contrasting grain densities and magnetic susceptibilities. Using support vector machines, it is shown that these two physical properties can be used to predict the rock type of a sample with an average precision and recall rate of 89{\%}. Within the meta-sedimentary rocks class, variations in magnetic susceptibility are due to the changes in mineralogy associated with hydrothermal alteration. These are caused by the destruction of iron-bearing silicate minerals and magnetite in unaltered rocks (10−4 to 10−3 SI) to form pyrite, carbonates, K-feldspar and Fe-depleted hydrothermal biotite in altered rocks (10−5 to 10−4 SI). Within the felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks, grain densities below 2.7 g/cm3 and magnetic susceptibilities in the 10−6 to 10−4 SI range yield the highest probabilities that a rock has been submitted to carbonate and pyrite alteration. However, magnetic susceptibility and grain density of these intrusive rocks are also dependent on their Fe2O3/Al2O3 and TiO2/Al2O3 ratios, which are not related to the hydrothermal alteration footprint, but are rather due to distinct protolith compositions. Within the mafic dykes, grain density is the best indicator of hydrothermal alteration. Unaltered mafic dykes (2.95 to 3.10 g/cm3) are mostly composed of amphibole, whereas altered mafic dykes (2.70 to 2.95 g/cm3) have reduced amphibole contents and higher abundances of carbonates, pyrite, quartz, and biotite alteration. The support vector machine classifier is extended to predict if meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have undergone hydrothermal alteration with average F1 scores of 73{\%}, 69{\%} and 93{\%}, respectively. In altered meta-sedimentary rocks, the integration of grain density and magnetic susceptibility allows the identification of altered but unmineralized samples. The classifier is further extended to predict if the gold content of meta-sedimentary rocks is above or below threshold values of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 ppm with average F1 scores of 83{\%}, 80{\%}, and 76{\%}, respectively. Using conceptual models of the rock physical properties at the Malartic District scale, it is shown that ground magnetic surveys are the most promising geophysical tool for early-stage greenfield exploration of this type of deposit. However, depending on the scale at which the surveys are conducted, magnetic susceptibility contrasts between the various investigated rock types can overshadow the specific signatures of hydrothermally altered rocks. This in part explains why past airborne geophysical exploration campaigns for this type of deposit in the Malartic District were inconclusive. Finally, the machine learning process used in this case study can be applied in advanced exploration stages, during which drilling and either subsequent laboratory petrophysical analyses of core samples or downhole geophysical surveys produce large amounts of data that can be used to train prediction models.},

Extraction of methane involves altering the existing conditions and these changes can lead to damage of the reservoir. For sustained production of coalbed methane (CBM), damage of coal needs to be minimized. Formation damage refers to the changes in the producing formation that leads to decline in coal permeability which eventually leads to the decline in production. This chapter discusses the various mechanisms in the reservoir that lead to formation damage. It describes and discusses the major types of formation damage that commonly occur when drilling CBM reservoirs. The emphasis is on the most common types of formation damage, that are those associated with drilling, completion, and specifically hydraulic fracturing. Further, damage due to volumetric deformation of coal matrix and production-related reservoir failure are also discussed.}

	abstract = {A method is given for further improving velocity estimates derived from high-resolution velocity analysis. In conventional velocity analysis, a set of tentative velocities is used to apply a normal moveout (NMO) correction to a set of spatio-temporal windows, the coherence measure is evaluated for each velocity and finally, the velocity estimate is retrieved from the peak of the coherence measure. Because analytical expressions for velocity uncertainties are difficult to derive, I propose an intensive statistical procedure, the bootstrap method, to assess the accuracy of the velocity estimate. In the bootstrap method, I create a data sample by randomly drawing seismic traces with replacement from a window of the common midpoint gather (CMP). Next, I calculate the velocity that maximizes the coherence measure for each bootstrap realization. The variation of this velocity provides a means to compute standard errors. I also use the bootstrap method to construct an average coherence measure and a kernel density estimator of the velocity that maximizes the coherence. The average coherence exhibits an important attenuation of spurious events while retaining enough resolution to model reflections properly with similar moveout curves. The latter is illustrated with synthetic and field data examples.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

@article{He2016,
	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

@article{Haber2018,
	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

	abstract = {Equivalent staggered grid scheme (ESG) is a new family of schemes based on the finite-difference method (FDM). The method is applied to acoustic wave propagation in variable density media and the results are compared with those from some classic FDM approaches. The main feature of this new family is that it is designed to generate results numerically equivalent to those using the standard staggered grid formulations (SSG), but with the same memory requirements of simple grid schemes. Hence, it results in a reduction of memory usage by 33{\%} in 2D and 50{\%} in 3D problems, compared to the memory usage of SSG. The first-order system of equations in terms of pressure and velocity is not used here. Instead, the formulation is based on applying new central difference operators to the second-order acoustic wave equation in terms of pressure, obtaining the same level of accuracy and stability as the SSG schemes. The equivalence between the ESG and SSG is mathematically demonstrated and issues concerning the application of seismic sources and the boundary conditions are addressed.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90{\%} accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.},

Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as approximately 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404+/-8 Myr--about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O values from 7.4 to 5.0{\%}), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high delta18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a delta18O value from 8.5 to 9.5{\%}. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As geophysicists, we are trained to conceptualize geophysical problems in detail. However, machine learning algorithms are more difficult to understand and are often thought of as simply “black boxes.” A numerical example is used here to illustrate the difference between geophysical inversion and inversion by machine learning. In doing so, an attempt is made to demystify machine learning algorithms and show that, like inverse problems, they have a definite mathematical structure that can be written down and understood. The example used is the extraction of the underlying reflection coefficients from a synthetic seismic response that was created by convolving a reflection coefficient dipole with a symmetric wavelet. Because the dipole is below the seismic tuning frequency, the overlapping wavelets create both an amplitude increase and extra nonphysical reflection coefficients in the synthetic seismic data. This is a common problem in real seismic data. In discussing the solution to this problem, the topics of deconvolution, recursive inversion, linear regression, and nonlinear regression using a feedforward neural network are covered. It is shown that if the inputs to the deconvolution problem are fully understood, this is the optimal way to extract the true reflection coefficients. However, if the geophysics is not fully understood and large amounts of data are available, machine learning can provide a viable alternative to geophysical inversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Furthermore, rock typing activity has been shown to be of key importance in several steps of formation evaluation, such as the study of sedimentary series, reservoir zonation and well-to-well correlation. In this paper, a methodology based exclusively on the analysis of 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation responses – using data mining algorithms – is evaluated to perform the automatic classification of carbonate samples according to their rock type. We analyze the effectiveness of six different classification algorithms (k-NN, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, C4.5, Random Forest, SMO and Multilayer Perceptron) and two data preprocessing strategies (discretization and feature selection). The dataset used in this evaluation is formed by 78 1H-NMR T2 distributions of fully brine-saturated rock samples from six different rock type classes. The experiments reveal that the combination of preprocessing strategies with classification algorithms is able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 97.4{\%}.},

Based on such maps, the clustering of factor spaces of different dimensions was carried out, and a representative sample was formed.

	abstract = {Field characterization in oil industry is a challenging task which aims to determine or estimate some of the petrophysical properties of a reservoir. These properties are expected to be later used in a non-deterministic workflow (which might depend on subjective interpretations carried out by each petrophysicist) whose aim is to answer questions such as whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. Three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. Obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. Hence, it is common to use other tools (such as wirelogging tools or borehole imagers) to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at which no core sample could be extracted. In this context, estimating lithofacies helps petrophysicists to automatize the process of identifying the lithology of the reservoir. Previous work (Basu et al., 2002; Chai et al., 2009; Linek et al., 2007; Newberry et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1996) used a considerable amount of wirelog data and borehole image logs to induce the lithology of the reservoir. In the work presented in this paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatic reservoir lithofacies identification. Our model relies only on ultrasonic and microresistivity borehole image logs as inputs, which are characterized by a deep residual convolutional network which then infers the probability of each sample to be classified as each type of previously defined lithofacies classes. The method presented in this work was tested on a carbonate well from the Brazilian pre-salt oilfields, and it allowed us to obtain an average classification accuracy of 81.45{\%} and an average area under the ROC curve of 92.70{\%} for all classes, for the blind test sample.},

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.},

However, such information is often limited for most groundwater basins. This study explores the usefulness and potential of a hybrid soft-computing framework; a traditional artificial neural network with gradient descent-momentum training (ANN-GDM) and a traditional genetic algorithm (GA) based ANN (ANN-GA) approach were developed and compared with a novel hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) based ANN (SOM-ANN-GA) method for the prediction of lithology at a basin scale. This framework is demonstrated through a case study involving a complex multi-layered aquifer system in India, where well-log sites were clustered on the basis of sand-layer frequencies; within each cluster, subsurface layers were reclassified into four depth classes based on the maximum drilling depth. ANN models for each depth class were developed using each of the three approaches. Of the three, the hybrid SOM-ANN-GA models were able to recognize incomplete geologic pattern more reasonably, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-GDM models. It is concluded that the hybrid soft-computing framework can serve as a promising tool for characterizing lithology in groundwater basins with missing lithologic patterns.},

	abstract = {Pattern recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a black box that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (x, y, and z) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a SOM model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decomposition algorithm to capture the sedimentary cycle pattern as an attribute. If we correlate this attribute to the training data, it will favor SOM facies maps that follow stratigraphy. We apply this workflow to a Barnett Shale data set and find that the constrained SOM facies map shows layers that are easily overlooked on traditional unconstrained SOM facies map.},

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Northern Amazon Province there is a succession of IS- or IF/IS-type sedimentary basins along the Solim{\~{o}}es/Amazonas river. The westernmost IS-type Acre Basin is interpreted as a retro arc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis (Jordan, 1995). Continental sediments filled a syneclisis from the Carboniferous until the Jurassic, with rocks of marine to continental environment followed by a flexure in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. East of this basin and separated from it by the Iquitos Arch, the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is internally divided in two by the Carauari Arch. It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. This IF-type basin is an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border between Brazil and Guyana, covering some 4,500 km2 of the Brazilian territory. Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. IS-type Cenozoic fluvial and lacustrine clastics of the Solim{\~{o}}es and Boa Vista basins were unconformably deposited above these basins. The former basin occupies a wide area of the Western Amazonia and the latter surrounds},

	abstract = {Accurate interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data in the presence of static shift arising from near-surface inhomogeneities is an unresolved problem in three-dimensional (3-D) inversion. While it is well known in 1-D and 2-D studies that static shift can lead to erroneous interpretation, how static shift can influence the result of 3-D inversion is not fully understood and is relevant to improved subsurface analysis. Using the synthetic data generated from 3-D models with randomly distributed heterogeneous overburden and elongate homogeneous overburden that are consistent with geological observations, this paper examines the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity on the accuracy of 3-D inversion models. It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

In the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin, situated in a remote semi-arid region of Brazil, groundwater is the main exploited min- eral resource.

One of us calculated 200 m ?? 50 m and 50 m ?? 50 m loop responses of a uniform polarizable conductor with varied Cole-Cole parameters and imposed synthetic Gaussian noise that simulated measurement errors. Then the generated pseudo-experimental data passed to the other co-author who performed single and joint 1D inversion twice: first being unaware of the "true" underlying models and then after being told that they all were represented by a uniform polarizable earth. More than a half of the fitted models provided a good idea of the true models though misfit was quite large in some cases. The fit was better in single inversion with a priori information available, and improved further through joint inversion of central-loop and coincident-loop responses. Joint inversion with a priori information known was of good quality even at a chargeability as low as 0.02. The standard error in joint inversion was times the measurement error and depended mainly on fitting errors for smaller-loop data. The reason is that the smaller-loop transients included a non-monotonous interval where the signal changed rapidly under the effect of fast-decaying induced polarization. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Breakup of the North Atlantic during the early tertiary was accompanied by widespread and massive magmatism, resulting in the coverage of large areas of the North Atlantic with flood basalts. These flood basalts hamper seismic investigations of underlying sequences and thus the understanding of the rifting, subsidence and evolution of the margin which, in turn, increases the risk for hydrocarbon exploration. In this paper we present a methodology for the simultaneous joint inversion of diverse geophysical datasets, i.e. free air gravity and magnetotelluric soundings (MT) using seismic a priori constraints. The attraction of the joint inversion approach is that different geophysical measurements are sensitive to different properties of the sub-surface, so through joint inversion we significantly reduce the null space and produce a single model that fits all datasets within a predefined tolerance. Using sensitivity analysis of synthetic data, we show how each data set contains complementary important information of the supra and sub-basalt structure. While separate inversions of individual datasets fail to image through the basalt layer, our joint inversion approach leads to a much improved sub-basalt structure. Application of the joint inversion algorithm to satellite gravity data and MT data acquired on the FLARE10 seismic line south west of Faroe islands supports the existence of a 1??km to 2??km thick low velocity region that might be indicative of the existence of a sedimentary basin underneath the basalt layer. Though in this paper we demonstrate the use of joint inversion on a sub-basalt target, we believe it has wider applicability to other areas where conventional seismic imaging fails. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

MATLAB has several useful toolboxes to solve complex problems in various fields of science, such as geophysics. In geophysics, the inversion of 2D DC resistivity imaging data is complex due to its non-linearity, especially for high resistivity contrast regions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of MATLAB to design, train and test a newly developed artificial neural network in inverting 2D DC resistivity imaging data. We used resilient propagation to train the network. The model used to produce synthetic data is a homogeneous medium of 100 ?? m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000 ?? m. The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD. The network was trained using 21 datasets and tested on another 16 synthetic datasets, as well as on real field data. In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing. Three different electrode spacings were measured, which gave a dataset of 330 data points. The interpreted result shows that the trained network was able to invert 2D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by a Wenner-Schlumberger configuration rapidly and accurately. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Time-lapse geophysical monitoring and inversion are valuable tools in hydrogeology for monitoring changes in the subsurface due to natural and forced (tracer) dynamics. However, the resulting models may suffer from insufficient resolution, which leads to underestimated variability and poor mass recovery. Structural joint inversion using cross-gradient constraints can provide higher-resolution models compared with individual inversions and we present the first application to time-lapse data. The results from a synthetic and field vadose zone water tracer injection experiment show that joint 3-D time-lapse inversion of crosshole electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) traveltime data significantly improve the imaged characteristics of the point injected plume, such as lateral spreading and center of mass, as well as the overall consistency between models. The joint inversion method appears to work well for cases when one hydrological state variable (in this case moisture content) controls the time-lapse response of both geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {An extensive study of the resistivity structure of the Hengill area in SW Iceland was carried out by the combined use of TEM and MT soundings. Joint inversion of the collected data can correct for static shifts in the MT data, which can be severe due to large near-surface resistivity contrasts. Joint 1D inversion of 148 TEM/MT sounding pairs and a 3D inversion of a 60 sounding subset of the MT data were performed. The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100-240 ??C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3-10 km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Seismic methods continue to receive interest for use in mineral exploration due to the much higher resolution potential of seismic data compared to the techniques traditionally used, namely, gravity, magnetics, resistivity, and electromagnetics. However, the complicated geology often encountered in hard-rock exploration can make data processing and interpretation difficult. Inverting seismic data jointly with a complementary data set can help overcome these difficulties and facilitate the construction of a common earth model. We considered the joint inversion of seismic first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data to recover causative slowness and density distributions. Our joint inversion algorithm differs from previous work by (1) incorporating a large suite of measures for coupling the two physical property models, (2) slowly increasing the effect of the coupling to help avoid potential convergence issues, and (3) automatically adjusting two Tikhonov tradeoff parameters to achieve a desired fit to both data sets. The coupling measures used are both compositional and structural in nature and allow the inclusion of explicitly known or implicitly assumed empirical relationships, physical property distribution information, and cross-gradient structural coupling. For any particular exploration scenario, the combination of coupling measures used should be guided by the geologic knowledge available. We performed our inversions on unstructured grids comprised of triangular cells in 2D, or tetrahedral cells in 3D, but the joint inversion methods are equally applicable to rectilinear grids. We tested our joint inversion methodology on scenarios based on the Voisey's Bay massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada. These scenarios present a challenge to the inversion of first-arrival traveltimes and we show how joint inversion with gravity data can improve recovery of the subsurface features.},

The main exploration targets are the top of the fractured Precambrian crystalline basement and any concealed basement grabens, the overlying presalt and salt/carbonate deposits, and the postsalt cover deposits. The results of joint inversion clearly mapped the various units and are a significant improvement over previous models derived from separate 2D seismic reflection processing and 2D magnetotelluric imaging.

As an illustration of this new approach, we present a model study relevant to exploration under cover for iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, and demonstrate how joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data is able to recover alteration associated with IOCG mineralization.

Unfortunately, reliable models of the deep structure of such areas are scarce due to poor surface exposure and limited availability of drill holes and high-resolution geophysical information. By combining multiple geophysical data sets, the strategy of cross-gradient joint geophysical inversion permits improved subsurface imaging of geological heterogeneity and structure. In this work we showcase the application of cross-gradient joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data to characterize the heterogeneity of the Leonora district in the eastern Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia.

Such structures are difficult to image with a single method, and our results demonstrate how combining different techniques can yield improved results. More importantly, we examine the reliability of velocity-conductivity relationships derived from structure-coupled joint inversion approaches. Comparison with a seismic reflection section shows that our models match the upper limit of the salt. Furthermore, velocity and resistivity logs from a borehole drilled into the salt dome's flank match, within error, those recovered by the inversion. The good match suggests that the difference in length scale does not have a significant effect in this case. This provides a strong incentive to incorporate borehole data into the joint inversion in the future and substantiates approaches that use the relationships derived from joint inversion models for lithological classification.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Carreira2013,
	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

	abstract = {The fracture porosity is estimated especially through the log data (density, neutron porosity and transit time) and the characteristics of the mud (fluid density, transit time of the saturating fluid). If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

	abstract = {This study integrates log-derived empirical formulas and the concept of the committee machine to develop an improved model for predicting permeability. A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We describe spatiotemporal variation in land cover over 80,000 km2 in central Rond{\^{o}}nia. We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85{\%} based on digital airborne videography. Rond{\^{o}}nia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rond{\^{o}}nia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2{\%}, increasing to 3{\%} by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18{\%} and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rond{\^{o}}nia (Ji-Paran{\'{a}}), deforestation rates rose from 1.2{\%} between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2{\%} in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5{\%} but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3{\%} in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paran{\'{a}} and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

A decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm was generated to illustrate the influence of geophysical parameters on the formation of tropical cyclone in weighted correlations. From the decision tree, we also induced decision rules to reveal the quantitative regularities and co-effects of [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear], [atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear], [sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], and other combinations to tropical cyclone formation.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning?

@article{Kong2016,
	abstract = {Large magnitude earthquakes in urban environments continue to kill and injure tens to hundreds of thousands of people, inflicting lasting societal and economic disasters. Earthquake early warning (EEW) provides seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people to move to safe zones and automated slowdown and shutdown of transit and other machinery. The handful of EEW systems operating around the world use traditional seismic and geodetic networks that exist only in a few nations. Smartphones are much more prevalent than traditional networks and contain accelerometers that can also be used to detect earthquakes. We report on the development of a new type of seismic system, MyShake, that harnesses personal/private smartphone sensors to collect data and analyze earthquakes. We show that smartphones can record magnitude 5 earthquakes at distances of 10 km or less and develop an on-phone detection capability to separate earthquakes from other everyday shakes. Our proof-of-concept system then collects earthquake data at a central site where a network detection algorithm confirms that an earthquake is under way and estimates the location and magnitude in real time. This information can then be used to issue an alert of forthcoming ground shaking. MyShake could be used to enhance EEW in regions with traditional networks and could provide the only EEW capability in regions without. In addition, the seismic waveforms recorded could be used to deliver rapid microseism maps, study impacts on buildings, and possibly image shallow earth structure and earthquake rupture kinematics.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

The relation between the training error and the generalization error is studied in terms of the number of the training examples and the complexity of a network which reduces to the number of parameters in the ordinary statistical theory of AIC. This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

	abstract = {Delineation of bed boundaries is one of the important aspects of petrophysical interpretation. Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {The set of geological elements that control the petroleum existence and distribution in the sedimentary basins are integrated under the concept of petroleum systems. Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

Development of the neural network model was completed using Generalized Regression Neural Network, and wireline logs from four wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, and resistivity logs. Synthetic logs were generated through two different exercises. Exercise one involved all four wells for training, calibration and verification process. The second exercise used three wells for training and calibration and the fourth well was used for verification.

In combination "B" the density log was output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the neutron logs, and XYZ were the inputs, and in combination "C" the neutron log was the output while the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the density logs, and XYZ were the inputs. After development of the neural network model, synthetic logs with a reasonable degree of accuracy were generated. Results indicate that the best performance was obtained for combination "A" of inputs and outputs, then for combination "C", and finally for combination "B". In addition, it was determined that accuracy of synthetic logs is favored by interpolation of data.

Using synthetic data is challenging due to the differences in feature distributions between synthetic and real data, a phenomenon we term synthetic gap. In this paper, we investigate and formalize a general framework - Stacked Multichannel Autoencoder (SMCAE) that enables bridging the synthetic gap and learning from synthetic data more efficiently. In particular, we show that our SMCAE can not only transform and use synthetic data on the challenging face-sketch recognition task, but that it can also help simulate real images, which can be used for training classifiers for recognition.

	abstract = {When using wireline log to characterize formation properties for an area we often run into incomplete datasets. One way to address this lack of data is to create synthetic curves to use in the analysis. This paper will cover workflows to generate synthetic photoelectric (PE) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) logs. Modern well log data sets usually include PE logs which provides important information about the lithology of the formations the wellbore intersects. However, many legacy wells do not have PE logs that we need in order to understand the lithology of these formations. Similarly, it is important to obtain UCS data from mechanical failure tests done to core samples to determine the strength of the rock. Obtaining and testing core samples for the entire zones of interest is both expensive and time consuming. Synthetic well logs can be a reliable and cheaper alternative to predicting PE and UCS values rather than running a new set of logs or coring and testing the whole zone of interest. In the first workflow, Synthetic PE logs were generated using wireline logs from over a hundred wells that included gamma ray, density, neutron, resistivity logs and volume of clay. The data was randomly partitioned into a 70:30 split for training and validation data set respectively. Model competition among a suite of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest was used to select the best algorithm based on the least average squared error (ASE) of the validation dataset. In the second workflow, UCS data was generated using wireline logs and core rebound hammer data from fourteen wells including gamma ray, density, porosity, neutron, clay volume, kerogen volume, compressional slowness, shear slowness, Young's modulus (static and dynamic) and Poison's ratio. Variable clustering was used to remove collinearity, decrease variable redundancy, and choose the best variables for analysis. Cluster analysis was performed on the chosen variables to identify factors that differentiate data segments from the population. The data was randomly portioned into a 70:30 training and validation split and model competition amongst the suite of machine learning algorithms mentioned above was used to select the champion model based on the least ASE of the validation dataset. Results show that neural networks and random forests generated the best prediction of UCS and synthetic PE logs compared to other machine learning algorithms used.},

In combination "B" the density log was output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the neutron logs, and XYZ were the inputs, and in combination "C" the neutron log was the output and the resistivity, the gamma ray, and the density logs, and XYZ were the inputs. After development of the neural network model, synthetic logs with a reasonable degree of accuracy were generated. Results indicate that the best performance was obtained for combination "A" of inputs and outputs, then for combination "C", and finally for combination "B". In addition, it was determined that accuracy of synthetic logs is favored by interpolation of data. As an important conclusion, it was demonstrated that quality of the data plays a very important role in developing a neural network model. Copyright 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The estimation of lithology from multiple geophysical survey methods needs to be addressed to develop advanced tomographic methods. An initial requirement for lithology discrimination is that lithology should be discriminable from the media properties physically related to the geophysical observations. To test this condition for different combinations of the most common crustal rocks, we performed several lithology discrimination exercises on rock samples under laboratory conditions. The physical properties included mass density, compressional velocity, shear velocity, electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility. A categorical description of the sample lithology was followed; hence, the inference consisted of predicting the sample rock category (lithotype) membership. The joint information provided by the physical properties of the rocks allowed us to discriminate the sample lithotype correctly, with an overall success rate of 100{\%} in the most favorable situation and over 85{\%} in the least favorable situation. We obtained successful classification results for a variety of common lithotypes (granite, gabbro, limestone, tuff, marble, basalt, and gneiss) using three common classification methods: clustering analysis, Gaussian classification, and discriminant analysis. Although discrimination was positive with each of these multivariate classification techniques, discriminant analysis showed some advantages for the classification and graphic analysis of the data. These results support our postulate that lithology can be estimated reliably if multiple geophysical observations are considered jointly.},

We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect.

	abstract={AbstractHole problems during the drilling phase of operations are often the consequence of mechanical wellbore instability. This leads to higher than necessary drilling costs. A linear-elastic analysis is frequently proposed for the prediction of the onset of failure, and consequently the mud weights required to prevent hole instability. However, there is no clear choice of which compressive failure criterion to use in the analysis. This paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed paper assesses the influence of two commonly proposed failure criteria on mud weight selection. The failure criteria selected is shown to have an extremely significant effect on the computed 'safe' mud weights. Examples related to field situations are presented which highlight the anomalies and contrary evidence relating to the suitability of failure criteria. IntroductionThe increasing demand for wellbore stability analyses during the planning stage of a field arises from economic considerations and the escalating use of deviated, extended reach and horizontal wells. Wellbore instability can result in lost circulation (Figure la) where tensile failure has occurred, and spalling and/or hole closure (Figure lb) in the case of compressive failure. In severe cases the hole instability can lead to stuck pipe and eventually loss of the open hole section. The causes of instability are often classified into either chemical or mechanical effects. Often, field instances of instability are a result of a combination of both chemical and mechanical effects. However, only mechanical effects are considered here. Due to the large costs associated with wellbore instability this subject has received considerable attention in the literature over the past two decades ([l] to [161). The majority of the literature focuses on analytical aspects of wellbore stability. In a previous publication [151 the authors reviewed strength criteria used in many of the models published and showed that certain criteria do not stand up to close scrutiny when compared with laboratory strength test data. In this paper the effect of strength criteria on mud weight selection is highlighted to show some of the anomalies and contrary evidence which can make the choice of a strength criterion difficult and confusing when performing wellbore stability analyses. 2.0 BACKGROUND TO WELLBORE STABILITY MODELLING Before a well is drilled, compressive stresses exist within the rock formations (Figure 2). With the exception of structurally complex areas (e.g. near salt diapirs), the in-situ stresses can be resolved into a vertical or overburden stress, , and two horizontal stresses, (the maximum horizontal stress), and (the minimum horizontal stress), which are generally unequal. When the well is drilled, the rock stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore are redistributed as the support originally offered by the drilled out rock is replaced by the hydraulic pressure of the mud. pressure of the mud.

Potential exists to minimize borehole problems by planning wellbore trajectory and orientation, the directions of perforations, and by implementing leak-off tests. Wellbore instabilities, while drilling or during completion and operation, are the consequence of many phenomena and several factors. These include solid–fluid interaction (between rock materials and drilling fluid), challenging and complex stress conditions, wellbore deviation and multiplicity, irregular formation reservoir behavior, inconsistency or lack of appropriate drilling and operating practices, deep-water operation, and high-pressure high-temperature reservoirs. In this chapter, we will discuss the first three phenomena in detail with the key focus on the main borehole failure mechanisms, that is, fracturing and collapse. We will show how the methods and data of the previous chapters are used to analyze borehole instability problems.}

Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle not only points objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.},

An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Results: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observations.},

We show how to accelerate it dramatically, while still always computing exactly the same result as the standard algorithm. The accelerated algorithm avoids unnecessary distance calculations by applying the triangle inequality in two different ways, and by keeping track of lower and upper bounds for distances between points and centers. Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases. For k ≥ 20 it is many times faster than the best previously known accelerated k-means method.},

	abstract = {The k-means algorithm is widely used for clustering, compressing, and summarizing vector data. In this paper, we propose a new acceleration for exact k-means that gives the same answer, but is much faster in practice. Like Elkan's accelerated algorithm [8], our algorithm avoids distance computations using distance bounds and the triangle inequality. Our algorithm uses one novel lower bound for point-center distances, which allows it to eliminate the innermost k-means loop 80{\%} of the time or more in our experiments. On datasets of low and medium dimension (e.g. up to 50 dimensions), our algorithm is much faster than other methods, including methods based on low-dimensional indexes, such as k-d trees. Other advantages are that it is very simple to implement and it has a very small memory overhead, much smaller than other accelerated algorithms.},

	abstract = {This paper is about metric data structures in high-dimensional or non-Euclidean space that permit cached sufficient statistics accelerations of learning algorithms. It has recently been shown that for less than about 10 dimensions, decorating kd-trees with additional "cached sufficient statistics" such as first and second moments and contingency tables can provide satisfying acceleration for a very wide range of statistical learning tasks such as kernel regression, locally weighted regression, k-means clustering, mixture modeling and Bayes Net learning. In this paper, we begin by defining the anchors hierarchy - a fast data structure and algorithm for localizing data based only on a triangle-inequality-obeying distance metric. We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data. But more importantly we show how it can produce a well-balanced structure similar to a Ball-Tree (Omohundro, 1991) or a kind of metric tree (Uhlmann, 1991; Ciaccia, Patella, {\&} Zezula, 1997) in a way that is neither "top-down" nor "bottom-up" but instead "middle-out". We then show how this structure, decorated with cached sufficient statistics, allows a wide variety of statistical learning algorithms to be accelerated even in thousands of dimensions.},

Three species of them are new: Echinocyamus belali, Antillaster farisi and Metalia lindaae. The Caribbean genus Antillaster which is recorded for the first time from the Mediterranean region, suggests an east – west migration from the Tethys and Paratethys to the Caribbean region during the Eocene time by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a westerly direction. The paleoecology and the paleogeography of the echinoid fauna are discussed. The paleoecological study appears to revel that the Middle Eocene rocks of that area were deposited in a shallow marine water conditions. Paleogeographically, 33.3{\%} of the total echinoids are endemic to Egypt, 66.7{\%} species are similar to that of the taxa of the adjacent countries.},

	abstract = {In oil reservoirs management one of the challenges is to predict the behaviour of the fluid flow. Identifying the flow units is complex task, therefore it is necessary to perform the characterization of rocks. Parameters such as porosity and permeability must be known. The use of statistics is useful to perform reservoir division into zones using core data and geophysical well logs. This research aims to apply two alternative well established techniques useful for the recognition of flow units in the Namorado field and conduct a comparative analysis of the techniques by looking at the results obtained in both approaches, as well as obtain the three-dimensional model of this field, as indicated by both techniques. The techniques used in this work are statistical zoning and flow zone index (FZI). In this research was used permeability data from 15 wells provided by the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency. In the first technique were calculated the variances between zones, grouped variances within zones and finally the zoning index with which it was possible divide the field into zones. On application of FZI the greatest value of the index indicated the depth of division between zones. After zones recognition, two model were constructed, the first one based on statistical zoning, indicating the zones; and the second based in FZI, pointing out the location of the zones corresponding to the reservoir and those associated with the non- reservoir. For the construction of three-dimensional models the geostatistical software SGeMS was used. According to the obtained results was evidenced that the techniques of statistical and FZI zoning have produced equivalent results in some wells, but different in others. However, the FZI method presented, in most wells, more satisfactory results compared to the statistical zoning. Keywords:},

	abstract = {A Bayesian linear inversion methodology based on Gaussian mixture models and its application to geophysical inverse problems are presented in this paper. The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary first-order Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30{\%} in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

It is known that these iterative techniques are especially sensitive to initial starting conditions. We present a procedure for computing a refined starting condition from a given initial one that is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. The refined initial starting condition allows the iterative algorithm to converge to a “better” local minimum. The procedure is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for both discrete and continuous data. We demonstrate the application of this method to the popular K-Means clustering algorithm and show that refined initial starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. Refinement run time is considerably lower than the time required to cluster the full database. The method is scalable and can be coupled with a scalable clustering algorithm to address the large-scale clustering problems in data mining.},

The wireline well logs used are sonic, gamma ray, neutron porosity, bulk density and resistivity. We solve this inverse problem in a predictive Bayesian setting, and perform the associated model parameter estimation. Spatial vertical structure of the facies is included in the model by a Markov chain assumption, making geological model interpretation possible. We also take convolution effect into account, assuming that the observed logs might be measured as a weighted sum of properties over a facies interval. We apply the methods on real well data, with thick facies layers inferred from core samples. The proposed facies classification model is compared to a naive Bayesian classifier, which does not take into account neither vertical spatial dependency, dependencies between the wireline well logs nor convolution effect. Results from a blind well indicate that facies predictions from our model are more reliable than predictions from the naive model in terms of correct facies classification and predicted layer thickness.},

Five stratigraphic cross sections were composed and allowed to the recognition of three depositional cycles for the Namorado Sandstones: bottom, intermidiate and top cycle. The mapped reservoir facies were interpreted as channel lobe complex in comparison with geometrical parameters description according to Bruhn {\&} Moraes (1988) model. Spatial analysis of net sand maps and simulated images suggest a NW-SE orientation for the depositional axis of turbiditic sandstones.

	abstract = {Image retrieval based on color histograms requires quantization of a color space. Uniform scalar quantization of each color channel is a popular method for the reduction of histogram dimensionality. With this method, however, no spatial information among pixels is considered in constructing the histograms. Vector quantization (VQ) provides a simple and effective means for exploiting spatial information by clustering groups of pixels. We propose the use of Gauss mixture vector quantization (GMVQ) as a quantization method for color histogram generation. GMVQ is known to be robust for quantizer mismatch, which motivates its use in making color histograms for both the query image and the images in the database. Results show that the histograms made by GMVQ with a penalized log-likelihood (LL) distortion yield better retrieval performance for color images than the conventional methods of uniform quantization and VQ with squared error distortion.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large da- tabases.

In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis- cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an ap- propriate value for it. We performed an experimental evalua- tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench- mark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clus- ters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR- ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency},

We then show that the algorithms do behave very differently from each other on simple low-dimensional synthetic datasets and image segmentation tasks, and that the A-harmonic means method is superior.

Standard statistical methods like linear and quadratic discriminant or cluster analysis treat the individual measurement points of well logs as independent samples of the underlying distribution. With hidden Markov models (HMM) the knowledge of statistical dependency between successive data points in a well log can be incorporated in the classification process. The sequence of lithological classes is modelled as a discrete, finite, homogeneous, first order Markov chain of transitions between states. This state sequence can be unobserved or is generally hidden from the observer. The only necessary information about the hidden state sequence is an observed sequence of state-dependent outputs. This output information is used to estimate the hidden state sequence which most probably has caused the given output sequence. The performance of HMM is evaluated on simulated data and on a real data set from eight wells near Berlin (Germany) with final depths between 60 and 140 metres. The results are compared with the outcome of the quadratic discriminant analysis.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Malartic deposit is a world class intrusion-related Archean gold deposit hosted in the Pontiac Subprovince, Superior Province, in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Laboratory petrophysical properties measurements were performed on 824 rock samples collected from the various rock types observed within the ore body and peripheral host rocks. The various rock types present in the Malartic District, mainly meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have contrasting grain densities and magnetic susceptibilities. Using support vector machines, it is shown that these two physical properties can be used to predict the rock type of a sample with an average precision and recall rate of 89{\%}. Within the meta-sedimentary rocks class, variations in magnetic susceptibility are due to the changes in mineralogy associated with hydrothermal alteration. These are caused by the destruction of iron-bearing silicate minerals and magnetite in unaltered rocks (10−4 to 10−3 SI) to form pyrite, carbonates, K-feldspar and Fe-depleted hydrothermal biotite in altered rocks (10−5 to 10−4 SI). Within the felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks, grain densities below 2.7 g/cm3 and magnetic susceptibilities in the 10−6 to 10−4 SI range yield the highest probabilities that a rock has been submitted to carbonate and pyrite alteration. However, magnetic susceptibility and grain density of these intrusive rocks are also dependent on their Fe2O3/Al2O3 and TiO2/Al2O3 ratios, which are not related to the hydrothermal alteration footprint, but are rather due to distinct protolith compositions. Within the mafic dykes, grain density is the best indicator of hydrothermal alteration. Unaltered mafic dykes (2.95 to 3.10 g/cm3) are mostly composed of amphibole, whereas altered mafic dykes (2.70 to 2.95 g/cm3) have reduced amphibole contents and higher abundances of carbonates, pyrite, quartz, and biotite alteration. The support vector machine classifier is extended to predict if meta-sedimentary rocks, felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks and mafic dykes have undergone hydrothermal alteration with average F1 scores of 73{\%}, 69{\%} and 93{\%}, respectively. In altered meta-sedimentary rocks, the integration of grain density and magnetic susceptibility allows the identification of altered but unmineralized samples. The classifier is further extended to predict if the gold content of meta-sedimentary rocks is above or below threshold values of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 ppm with average F1 scores of 83{\%}, 80{\%}, and 76{\%}, respectively. Using conceptual models of the rock physical properties at the Malartic District scale, it is shown that ground magnetic surveys are the most promising geophysical tool for early-stage greenfield exploration of this type of deposit. However, depending on the scale at which the surveys are conducted, magnetic susceptibility contrasts between the various investigated rock types can overshadow the specific signatures of hydrothermally altered rocks. This in part explains why past airborne geophysical exploration campaigns for this type of deposit in the Malartic District were inconclusive. Finally, the machine learning process used in this case study can be applied in advanced exploration stages, during which drilling and either subsequent laboratory petrophysical analyses of core samples or downhole geophysical surveys produce large amounts of data that can be used to train prediction models.},

	abstract = {Coal is an unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir which is both the source and reservoir for the formed methane. Extraction of methane involves altering the existing conditions and these changes can lead to damage of the reservoir. For sustained production of coalbed methane (CBM), damage of coal needs to be minimized. Formation damage refers to the changes in the producing formation that leads to decline in coal permeability which eventually leads to the decline in production. This chapter discusses the various mechanisms in the reservoir that lead to formation damage. It describes and discusses the major types of formation damage that commonly occur when drilling CBM reservoirs. The emphasis is on the most common types of formation damage, that are those associated with drilling, completion, and specifically hydraulic fracturing. Further, damage due to volumetric deformation of coal matrix and production-related reservoir failure are also discussed.}

	abstract = {A method is given for further improving velocity estimates derived from high-resolution velocity analysis. In conventional velocity analysis, a set of tentative velocities is used to apply a normal moveout (NMO) correction to a set of spatio-temporal windows, the coherence measure is evaluated for each velocity and finally, the velocity estimate is retrieved from the peak of the coherence measure. Because analytical expressions for velocity uncertainties are difficult to derive, I propose an intensive statistical procedure, the bootstrap method, to assess the accuracy of the velocity estimate. In the bootstrap method, I create a data sample by randomly drawing seismic traces with replacement from a window of the common midpoint gather (CMP). Next, I calculate the velocity that maximizes the coherence measure for each bootstrap realization. The variation of this velocity provides a means to compute standard errors. I also use the bootstrap method to construct an average coherence measure and a kernel density estimator of the velocity that maximizes the coherence. The average coherence exhibits an important attenuation of spurious events while retaining enough resolution to model reflections properly with similar moveout curves. The latter is illustrated with synthetic and field data examples.},

	abstract = {Coal samples from the Permian Rio Bonito Formation, collected from borehole MML-09 east of Maracaj{\'{a}}, South Santa Catarina, Paran{\'{a}} Basin, Brazil, were characterized by petrological (vitrinite reflectance measurements, maceral analyses) and geochemical (Rock-Eval, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and GC-MS) methods. The mean vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.73 to 0.87% Rrandom, indicating a rank level of high volatile B/A bituminous. The maceral composition showed predominance of vitrinite (49.4 to 61.2vol.%) and inertinite (9 to 24.5vol.%). The Rock-Eval analysis presented the following values: S1 and S2 ranging from 0.74 to 2.51mg HC/g coal and 34.1 to 108.87mg HC/g coal, respectively; Hydrogen Indices between 158 and 240mg HC/g TOC and Tmax (°C) between 440 and 448°C. The TOC contents of the coal samples present values ranging from 18.85 to 45.31wt.%. Vitrinite reflectance and Rock-Eval Tmax values indicate that the coals are in the beginning of the oil generation window. The potential for the formation of liquid hydrocarbons is rather low, due to the nature of the humic coal, whereas the rank level indicates that generation of gas from the coal has occurred. The biomarker analysis, using GC-MS and GC-MS-MS, allowed the interpretation of the depositional environment and provided another way of determining the degree of maturity of the coals, besides vitrinite reflectance and Tmax. The pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratio is >1, mainly controlled by organic matter type, implied suboxic conditions during sedimentation. The vitrinite reflectance measurements, Tmax values and 20S/(20S+20R) and $\alpha$$\beta$$\beta$/($\alpha$$\beta$$\beta$+$\alpha$$\alpha$$\alpha$) ratios for C29 regular steranes revealed the marginally mature stage of the organic matter, although the distribution of hopanes indicated a mature stage of the organic matter, due to the absence of $\beta$$\beta$ hopanes and predominance of the 22S epimer over the 22R epimer for the hopanes from C-31 to C-35. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Two samples from the upper and lower horizons of the Irati oil shale of the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, Brazil were sampled in a single borehole, and analysed using organic petrography and geochemistry. The results are interpreted in terms of the kerogen type, maturity and depositional environment of the two horizons. Organic petrography shows the oil-shales to be composed of a mineral groundmass, mainly clay minerals, carbonate and pyrite, associated, and sometimes impregnated, with fluorescing organic material and disseminated phytoclasts. Humic material is fairly rare and mostly present as very small particles. The liptinitic particles are mostly alginite (A and B), sporinite and more rarely resinite. Reflectance measurements (upper seam = 0.34% R0; lower seam = 0.40% R0) indicate an equivalent rank of lignite/sub-bituminous coal (ASTM), i.e. immature with respect to oil and gas generation. Different organic geochemical methods (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, solvent extraction, GC and GC-MS) demonstrate both samples to be immature, rich oil-shales (100-114 kg/ton) containing Type I kerogen, of a dominantly bacterially-degraded algal origin deposited in a lacustrine environment. The presence of Botryococcus suggests deposition under fresh/brackish water conditions. A tentative interpretation of the extract and vitrinite reflectance data suggests a maximum paleo-burial of between 1.3 and 2.8 km for the analysed section of the Irati Formation. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

Current methods that are used for TOC estimation are based, either on conducting time-consuming laboratory experiments, or on using empirical correlations developed for specific formations. In this study, four artificial intelligence (AI) models were developed to estimate the TOC using conventional well logs of deep resistivity, gamma-ray, sonic transit time, and bulk density. These models were developed based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy interference system (TSK-FIS), Mamdani fuzzy interference system (M-FIS), functional neural network (FNN), and support vector machine (SVM). Over 800 data points of the conventional well logs and core data collected from Barnett shale were used to train and test the AI models. The optimized AI models were validated using unseen data from Devonian shale. The developed AI models showed accurate predictability of TOC in both Barnett and Devonian shale. FNN model overperformed others in estimating TOC for the validation data with average absolute percentage error (AAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) of 12.02%, and 0.879, respectively, followed by M-FIS and SVM, while TSK-FIS model showed the lowest predictability of TOC, with AAPE of 15.62% and R of 0.832.

Different algorithms have been applied for L1 norm minimization among which the linear programming problem based on the simplex method is well known. In the present contribution, in order to solve an L1 norm minimization problem in a linear model, an interior point algorithm is developed which is based on Dikin's method. The method can be considered as an appropriate alternative for the classical simplex method, which is sometimes time-consuming. The proposed method, compared with the simplex method, is thus easier for implementation and faster in performance. Furthermore, a recursive form of the Dikin's method is derived, which resembles the recursive least-squares method. Two simulated numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm gives as accurate results as the simplex method but in considerably less time. When dealing with a large number of observations, this algorithm can thus be used instead of the iteratively reweighted least-squares method and the simplex method. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASCE.},

	abstract = {Total organic carbon (TOC) is an important parameter in the evaluation of kerogen-rich unconventional reservoirs; therefore, a continuous, accurate wireline TOC log is highly desirable. Recent advances in geochemical spectroscopy logging make it possible to obtain an accurate and robust TOC log without the need to calibrate to core. A new tool simultaneously measures carbon and the major elements, calcium and magnesium, that form carbonate minerals, from which TOC is derived as the difference between total carbon and inorganic (mineral) carbon at acceptable open hole logging speeds. This method differs considerably from the current practice of estimating TOC from conventional log measurements based on empirical approaches. Two well-established and proven techniques are the Schmoker density-log technique and the combination sonic- (or density-) and resistivity-log technique known as $\Delta$ log R. Other common methods for TOC estimation include using uranium or gamma ray logs as indicators of organic matter, although they often require a local calibration. The Schmoker density-log technique uses the bulk density log and assumes that the change in density of the formation is due to the presence or absence of low-density organic matter ($\sim$1.0 g/cm3). The $\Delta$ log R technique relies on separation of the sonic (or density) and resistivity curves to identify areas containing organic matter and the subsequent derivation of TOC from the separation of the two curves based on the level of organic maturity. Each of these quantitative approaches has been compared with TOC measured by coulometry on hundreds of core samples in field tests covering a variety of formations and wells drilled with both water- and oil-based muds. The organic carbon content of the core samples ranges from 0 to over 15 wt%, and the carbonate mineral content ranges from 0 to almost 100 wt%. TOC from the geochemical spectroscopy log agrees very well with the core data, matching as well as or better than the Schmoker or $\Delta$ log R techniques for all datasets. The accuracy and robustness of the TOC derived from spectroscopy logging plays a key role in accounting for organic content when computing density and porosity for unconventional reservoirs to ensure accurate and consistent evaluation across varying rock compositions, deposit ional environments, and hydrocarbon maturities.},

	abstract = {The total organic carbon content (TOC) is a crucial indicator for the evaluation of shale gas reservoirs, traditionally estimated by measuring cores, cuttings or sidewall cores in laboratory with source rock evaluation instruments. Limited by the number of rock samples, the experimental results are not continuous and it is impossible to show the whole face of a source rock bed. Continuous high resolution logging information contributes to overcoming the restraints mentioned above. In this paper, the measured TOC data obtained from geochemical analysis of the core samples has a really low correlation with any single logging curve from a shale gas well in southern China. The TOC calculated from the commonly used method △logR technique has a relatively low correlation with the measured ones, especially in the interval of low TOC. Three methods of △logR technique, optimal superposition coefficient△logR technique, CARBOLOG (Carbon Organic LOG) technique are applied to calculate TOC and compared. Calculated results show that TOC from CARBOLOG technique is better related to the measured TOC with the correlation coefficient for 0.83. Based on the calculated TOC from CARBOLOG technique, analysis of TOC effects on rock properties is performed, showing the characteristics of high S-wave Impendence (SI), high poisson's ratio ($\nu$), high Vp/Vs ratio (VpVs) with high TOC, which is consistent well with the forward modeling results using the 3D SCA_DEM rock physics model for organic-rich shale.},

So it is especially important to establish a regional experimental calculation model based on a thorough analysis of their applicability. With the Upper Ordovician Wufeng Fm-Lower Silurian Longmaxi Fm shale reservoirs as an example, TOC calculation models were built by use of the improved $\Delta$lgR, bulk density, natural gamma spectroscopy, multi-fitting and volume model methods respectively, considering the previous research results and the geologic features of the area. These models were compared based on the core data. Finally, the bulk density method was selected as the regional experimental calculation model. Field practices demonstrated that the improved $\Delta$lgR and natural gamma spectroscopy methods are poor in accuracy; although the multi-fitting method and bulk density method have relatively high accuracy, the bulk density method is simpler and wider in application. For further verifying its applicability, the bulk density method was applied to calculate the TOC of shale reservoirs in several key wells in the Jiaoshiba shale gas field, Sichuan Basin, and the calculation accuracy was clarified with the measured data of core samples, showing that the coincidence rate of logging-based TOC calculation is up to 90.5%–91.0%.},

The core was analyzed for matrix density, Fischer Assay, total organic carbon (TOC), mineralogy, and 58 inorganic elemental concentrations. Logs include neutron, density, gamma ray, resistivity, magnetic resonance, and inelastic and capture nuclear spectroscopy. The data from this well are used to demonstrate new methodologies to estimate the TOC content and Fischer Assay oil yield. The TOC content is estimated in three ways. The first is a multitool petrophysical evaluation. The second is an estimation of kerogen from the difference between density and magnetic resonance (MR) porosities where MR porosity corresponds to the water-filled porosity and density porosity to the sum of kerogen- and water-filled porosity. The third method combines inelastic and capture nuclear spectroscopy log data to compute elemental concentration logs of total carbon, inorganic carbon, and TOC. For comparison of core mineralogy and chemistry with log data, over 200 intervals of core from this well were sampled as 2-ft-long slabs that were ground and homogenized, approximating the vertical resolution of log responses. The agreement between the logs and core values for total carbon, total inorganic carbon, and TOC is very good. The TOC log is used to activate empirical relationships such as Fischer Assay oil shale grade from TOC, again with good results. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

The seams occur in the Rio Bonito Formation, Guat{\'{a}} Group, Tubar{\~{a}}o Supergroup of the Paran{\'{a}} Basin and are of Permian (Artinskian-Kungurian) age. The composition, rank, coal facies and depositional environment characterization were made based on lithotype, maceral and microlithotype analyses. The data were then used in the definition of different types of facies-critical petrographical indices and were displayed in diagrams of coal facies. In addition, coal seams samples from Candiota Mine were analyzed by proximate, total moisture and gross calorific values and were classified using the United Nations-Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) classification. In addition, Rock-Eval Pyrolysis, Liquid Chromatography, GC and GC-MS analyses were made to obtain independent parameters on coal rank and organic matter composition and environment of deposition. The results suggest deposition in open mires, with elevated contents of detrital macerals and clay minerals and also limno-telmatic coal facies. Coal-bearing sequence of coal seams represent a back-barrier setting. According to the International Classification (UN-ECE), Candiota coals are in the subbituminous (or low rank coal A) stage. Results from geochemical analyses showed that terrestrial organic matter is predominant as indicated by hydrogen and oxygen indices, carbon preference indices and the sterane distribution.

	abstract = {Dry and brine-saturated clay aggregates ranging from pure smectite to pure kaolinite were compacted in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted by increasing vertical effective stress up to 50 MPa to study the changes in physical properties of mudstones during burial. The results suggest that the physical properties (porosity, density, acoustic velocity, etc.) of mudstones vary greatly with increasing effective stress, clay mineralogy and fluid content. Kaolinite aggregates are much more compressible than those composed of smectite. Brine-saturated clay mixtures are much more compressible than dry clay mixtures. Brine may soften and lubricate the clay matrix compared to dry clays, resulting in higher compressibility in the brine-saturated state. The lesser degree of compaction of dry smectite compared to dry kaolinite aggregates can be explained by the differences in grain size as kaolinitic clays have much larger grains than smectitic clays. The extremely fine-grained nature of smectite implies that the imposed vertical stress is distributed over a very large number of grain contacts so that the force per contact area is very low in smectite compared to that in coarse-grained kaolinite. At 20 MPa effective stress, corresponding to about 2 km burial depth with hydrostatic pore pressure, brine-saturated pure kaolinite compacted to 20% porosity, while pure smectite retained 41% porosity. Brine-saturated clay mixtures show higher Vp and lower Vs than dry clay mixtures. A pronounced difference in Vs was observed among the brine-saturated clay mixtures. The lowest Vs as a function of vertical effective stress was found for pure smectite. For a given porosity value, smectitic clays have higher velocities and elastic moduli than the kaolinitic clays. The Vp/Vs ratio is significantly higher in smectite than in kaolinite aggregates. Treating mudstones as a uniform class of rocks introduces significant errors in estimates of physical properties, which are strongly affected by the clay mineralogy, grain size, the amount of other minerals present and fluid content. Our results have implications for well log interpretation and mudstone and shale property determinations from seismic data at shallow burial depth (<2 km, 80 °C), above depths where significant chemical compaction takes place. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper examines a glacial diamictite-bearing succession from the upper Itararé Group (Taciba Formation) in eastern Paraná Basin, Brazil. The object of study provides the opportunity to investigate in detail the late stages of glacial sedimentation during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) in this sector of SW Gondwana, with implications for glacial cyclicity and regional paleo-ice flow reconstructions. Sedimentology, geological mapping and palynological analysis allowed the recognition of four facies associations, comprising subaqueous outwash, mass-transport, tide-influenced delta-front, and tide-influenced delta plain deposits. The succession records at least two episodes of ice-margin advance and retreat into a marine-influenced environment and can be placed in the earliest Permian based on the palynomorph assemblage. Cross stratification in outwash facies and deltaic deposits indicate sediment transport to the SW, the same revealed by deformational structures in mass-transport diamictites derived from downslope resedimentation of glaciomarine sediments during deglaciation. A glacial source to NE is therefore indicated and is in agreement with paleo-ice flow directions obtained from previously studied localities to the north. This north-derived early Permian glaciation contrasts with glacial sources to the SE recognized in the lower and middle intervals of the Itararé Group. The scenario suggests a geometric reconfiguration of the Paraná Basin during the LPIA and the migration of ice centers with time during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age in SW Gondwana.}
